<p>The linguistic relations between the Germanic group and the other Indo-European branches are a corollary to their geographical location and spread. The actual starting-point of the Indo-Europeans, their original home ('Urheimat'), is not known. At present, the greater weight of arguments seems to point to Northern or Central Europe,/EN1/ but the views favoring South-Eastern Europe/EN2/ or the steppes of Western Asia/EN3/ are not to be underrated. The conflicting views can in a measure be reconciled by assuming that the ethnic and linguistic conformity of the Indo-European group developed in a wide zone of migration,/EN4/ which extended 'from the 35th parallel N.L., from South-East to North-West, towards the Polar Circle',/EN5/ or 'on a long belt of land, reaching from France through all of Europe and the Kirghiz Steppe, as far as Iran'./EN6/</p>

<p>The concept of an Indo-European family is based upon linguistic facts, but docs not imply any anthropological coherence. We have no right whatever to speak of an Indo-European ('Aryan') race. Lin­guistic archeology (Hirt, Schrader, Much, Feist, and others) has drawn from linguistic material important conclusions as to common elements of an Indo-European culture, and many of these conclusions are doubt­less correct. A varying proportion of identical vocabulary in the several Indo-European languages indicates certain facts of social and economic conditions common to all or most Indo-European linguistic groups. But to what extent this postulates the assumption of an 'Urvolk' is still problematic. Even the process through which separate Indo-European languages developed is not entirely clear. August Schleicher/EN7/ conceived the Indo-European primitive language as the trunk of a linguistic 'Stammbaum'. This branches out into a northern and southern group (Slavo-German and Aryo-Graeco-Italo-Celtic), and these main branches are subdivided in the form of the diagram (adapted) shown at the top of the following page.</p>

	<p><img src="images/Image1.png" /></p>

<p>More conservatively, Johannes Schmidt/EN8/ represented the relation­ship of the Indo-European languages in the form of intersecting circles, indicating that any two neighboring groups possess certain common characteristics (the diagram is slightly modified; Schmidt could not include Tocharian and Hittite):</p>

	<p><img src="images/Image2.png" /></p>

<p>A. Meillet/EN9/ uses the following diagram as an adaptation of Schmidt's 'wave theory':</p>

	<p><img src="images/Image3.png" /></p>

<p>Schleicher's theory is demonstrably incorrect. The systems of Schmidt and Meillet are not theories, but graphic representations of undeniable geographical facts. As such, they are obviously correct, but they do not attempt to explain the facts.</p>

<p>Linguistic Substrata(H2)/EN10/. Both racially and linguistically the Indo-European group constitutes a complicated blend in which the proportions of the common elements vary greatly from branch to branch. In addition to the common stock, every one of them had absorbed a great deal from the languages that had formed in the course of earlier migration all along the Indo-European belt. In many instances we have archeological, or even historical, evidence of aboriginal ele­ments; thus the Celts largely represent an Indo-European expansion over Iberian (Basque) territory; the Slavs expanded over wide stretches of Finnish soil; the Hindus overwhelmed and partly absorbed Tibeto-Burmese, Dravidian, and Austro-Asiatic populations. The assumed aboriginal stock in a language is commonly termed the 'linguistic substratum'. The existence of such elements has been established with some probability in many instances, but the task is very elusive, and little certainty has as yet been attained. As to the Germanic languages, it has frequently been assumed that in the Baltic basin Indo-European speech was super-imposed over a pre-historic population of northern Europe, of whose speech, race, or culture nothing whatever is known. So far, all attempts to define it or to identify it with any known stock, for instance the Finns, have failed. Nevertheless, the existence of some 'Pre-Germanic Substratum' is prob­able, although for geographical and other reasons the common Indo-European element seems to predominate more definitely in the Germanic group than any­ where else. Some authorities, indeed, attach great importance to the hypo­thetical substratum. Their weightiest argument rests on the assumption that a very large proportion (one third or more) of the Germanic vocabulary has no cognates in other Indo-European languages, a claim based chiefly on the con­cluding table in Bruno Liebich's Wortfamilien der deutschen Sprache (/Ref1/1899, /Ref2/1905), which lists 504 Germanic, 211 West-Germanic, and 159 German 'roots' against 611 roots of Indo-European, or at least 'European', origin. But this table merely sums up the ultra-conservative etymologies in Heyne's Deutsches Wörterbuch. Since then, further etymological analysis has reduced the sup­posedly non-Indo-European element to a negligible quantity.</p>

<p>The assumption of an Indo-European zone of migration presupposes very early expansions, but we can­not define the center of radiation. By the second millennium B.C. the natural limits of the 'Eurasian Tract' had doubtless been extended, and the more or less homogeneous ethnic and linguistic stock had dis­integrated into numerous smaller units.	In the course of time, many ot them re-integrated, being absorbed by leading groups, and these new, larger units in turn again split up into sub-divisions-a process which is illustrated most clearly by the Romance group: The Italic group was absorbed by one of its members, namely Latin. This formed a number of dialects, in France, in Italy, in Spain, in Rumania. The rise of the dialect of the Isle de France as 'Standard French' super­imposed a new standard upon the numerous sub-languages of French­--and the process still continues.</p>
<p>The earlier phases of the expansion that led to the formation of the Indo-European languages seem to have been these:</p>

<p>I. The Prairie Group of Southern Russia spread partly towards the southeast, forming various Indo-European languages in western Asia (Phrygian, Armenian) and eventually branching out into the im­portant <i>Indo-Iranian</i> group; to this belong the Hindu languages, of which Sanskrit is an early representative, and the "languages of the plateau of Iran (Avestan, Persian), Ossetic, Scythian, and others. Another part of the Prairie Group expanded to the north and west, forming the <i>Balto-Slavic</i> branch (Baltic = Lithuanian, Lettish, Old Prussian; Slavic = Russian, Polish, Czech, Sorbian, Slovenian, Serbo­-Croatian, Bulgarian). A third branch spread to the south-east, into Asia Minor (<i>Phrygians</i>), and later a part of them migrated to the Balkan Peninsula, where they appear under the name of <i>Thracians</i>. The <i>Illyrians</i>, who occupied the northwestern part of the peninsula, may also have belonged to this branch. We know very little of their language. The <i>Albanians</i>, who at present inhabit the southern sec­tion of the former Illyrian territory, may be Illyrians, or they may be Thracians who had to abandon their more eastern home in conse­quence of the Turkish invasion.</p>
<p>The spread of the Prairie Group over Asia Minor had been preceded by that of a people that spoke a sister language of Indo-European, the <i>Hiltites</i>./EN1/ In eastern Turkestan linguistic vestiges of a later Indo­-European immigration have been found, the <i>Tocharian</i>/EN2/</p>

<p>II. The Park Land Group inhabited the forest and meadow dis­tricts of central Europe; a more accurate demarcation of its home is hardly possible. Apparently it separated during the second millen­nium before our era into an eastern and a western branch. The former migrated south and south-east, forming several Balkan languages, notably <i>Hellenic</i> (Greek), possibly also Illyric. The remainder of this group probably lived in the territory between the middle Danube and the Hercynian Mountains, that is, chiefly in present Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, and perhaps parts of southern Germany. They expanded to the north as far as geographical and climatic conditions made the land inhabitable after the ice cap of the last glacial epoch had receded--a process that occupied thousands of years.</p>
<p>One branch of this group either skirted or traversed the eastern Alps and drifted into Italy from the northeast. These formed the <i>Italic</i> languages, of which Latin became the most important. Another branch spread over southern and western Germany and later over France, the British Isles, and parts of Spain and northern Italy: these were the <i>Celts</i>.</p>
<p>The northern expansion gradually extended over northern Germany between the Elbe and Oder or Vistula, and southern Scandinavia. This is the Germanic group of the Indo-Europeans.</p>

<p>The distinction between the eastern and western spheres of expansion (the 'Prairie' and 'Park Land' groups) is not merely geographical, but linguistic as well. In sounds, vocabulary, and certain features of de­clension and conjugation, the languages of either group are closer to one another than to those of the other group. Thus Greek has prob­ably more features in common with Italic than with any of the Eastern languages, although there is no foundation for the frequent assumption of an especially close connection between the two 'classical' languages; in fact, Latin is more closely related to Celtic and Germanic than to Greek. It has become customary to designate the eastern group as <i>satem</i> languages, the western group as <i>kentum</i> languages ('100' = L. <i>centum</i>, Av. <i>satəm</i>; cf. <b>11</b>). While this distinction in itself is of minor importance, it offers a convenient nomenclature for the two branches.</p>

<p>Even at present a part of Europe remains non-Indo-European.	The Lapps and Finns (of many tribes) in northern Scandinavia, Finland, Russia, together with the Hungarians, belong to the <i>Finno-Ugrian</i> branch of the Ural-Altaic family of languages, which covers the larger part of northern and a good deal of central Asia. The <i>Turks</i>, who now occupy but a very small part of Europe, also belong to this family. In the western Pyrenees there still lives a remnant of the <i>Basques</i> who formerly must have occupied a very large part of France, since the Vosges Mountains still bear their name (L. <foreign xml:lang="la">Silva Vasconum</foreign>, MHG <foreign xml:lang="gmh">Wasgenwalt</foreign>). Many other languages of early Europe are extinct. Of these, perhaps the most important was <i>Etruscan</i>, which, like Basque, is of unknown origin. The meaning of very few Etruscan words is defi­nitely known, although it was still a living language in late Roman times.</p>
<p>It is a moot question whether the Indo-European languages are re­lated to other groups. Arguments for relationship between Indo­-European and Finno-Ugrian, or Semitic, or some languages of the Caucasus, have frequently been offered, but no proof has as yet been furnished.</p>

<p><h1><a name="1_3">3 The Germanic Languages</a></h1></p>

<p>The Germanic Languages represent, on the whole, that branch of a the Indo-European group that remained longest in or near the original home of the Indo-Europeans. Aside from their gradual expansion towards the uninhabitated or sparsely settled north, they remained there during the pre-Christian era. The land between the Elbe and the Oder, north of the Hercynian Mountains and extending into south­ern Scandinavia, was the 'Urheimat' of the Germanic group in the sense that it was there that they developed those linguistic, cultural, and physical characteristics that made them a separate branch of the Indo­-European family. Apparently, this is not in agreement with numerous reports of historians, from the Goth Jordanes (550) to the Frank Fre­chulf (about 830), according to whom at least the Goths, or even all Germanic tribes, came from Scandinavia-<foreign xml:lang="la">'ex Scandza imula'</foreign> (<i>Scati­navia</i>, <i>Scadanau</i>, ON <foreign xml:lang="non">Skāney</foreign>, Sw. <foreign xml:lang="swe">\Skåne</foreign>, OE 	<foreign xml:lang="ang">Scedenige</foreign>). The tradi­tion as such is probably well founded, but the scope of the geographical term is hardly identical with its present meaning. (The spelling <i>Scandinavia</i> has come down to us from Pliny's Historia Naturalis, where also the correct form <foreign xml:lang="la">Scadinavia</foreign> occurs.) The name is a com­pound from Gmc. <i>*skaþō(n)-</i>, ON <foreign xml:lang="non">skaþe</foreign>, OHG <foreign xml:lang="goh">scado</foreign> 'harm, damage', OE <foreign xml:lang="ang">sceaþe</foreign> 'fiend' and Gmc. <i>*awī</i> 'island, land by the water' (Latinized <foreign xml:lang="la">-avia</foreign>, as in <foreign xml:lang="la">Bat-avia</foreign>), Go. <foreign xml:lang="got">*awi</foreign>, gen. <foreign xml:lang="got">aujōs</foreign>, ON <foreign xml:lang="non">ey</foreign>, OE <foreign xml:lang="ang">ēg</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="ang">īg</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la">ēglond</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="ang">īglond</foreign> (NE <foreign xml:lang="eng">island</foreign>), OHG <foreign xml:lang="goh">ouwa</foreign>, NHG <foreign xml:lang="ger">Au</foreign>; it must have meant something like 'Perilous Shores', <foreign xml:lang="ger">Schadenau</foreign>. Karsten (<ref>Die Germanen 72 ff.</ref>) has made it extremely probable that Scadinavia denoted the lands around the southern Baltic--at least, southern Sweden, the Danish Isles, and Jutland, but probably also northern Germany around the Elbe (accord­ing to the Historia Langubardorum, the Langobards came from <i>Scatenauge</i> on the lower Elbe). It is possible that the name merely referred to the dangers of navigation in the southern Baltic, with its sudden squalls and rocky cliffs, or it may have been due to the inundation of parts of that territory during the last millennium B.C., through which Scandinavia and the Danish Isles became separated from the European main land.</p>

<p>In this territory of scanty natural resources, overpopulation was a chronically recurrent condition, leading to frequent emigrations and ex­pansions. Shortly before the beginning of our era, the Germanic group appears to have been a fairly homogeneous linguistic and cultural unit. This is the period that is termed <i>Urgermanisch</i>, Primitive Germanic. For that period we may speak of an incipient division into a North Germanic, Central Germanic, and South Germanic branch. The first of these occupied most of southern Sweden and a fringe of Norway; the second originally extended over the southernmost part of Sweden, Jutland, the Danish Isles, and the zone of inundation that gradually became Kattegat, Belt, Sund (and Limfjord, in northern Jutland): the third belonged to northern Germany, between the Elbe and the Oder. When the larger part of the central group had emigrated to the southeast and east (see below) and its remainder had been absorbed by the converging expansion of the other two groups, we find a new grouping--approximately since the beginning of the Christian era--, which we term <i>North Germanic</i>, <i>East Germanic</i>, and, in contrast to the latter, <i>West Germanic</i>. The eastern group, as is to be expected, shows linguistic contacts with both groups, due to its former location be­ tween them.</p>

<p>Note: 'Urgermanisch' and 'Gemeingermanisch' are different linguistic con­ cepts, although for the purpose of this book the distinction is of little importance. The former refers to the Germanic language in that pre-historic period when the division into dialects was not yet clearly apparent; the latter is applied to lin­guistic developments that took place in all Germanic languages, but independ­ently of each other. Thus, the first consonant shift is termed 'Primitive Ger­manic' 'Urgermanisch', for which this book uses the term 'Germanic'; the develop­ment of the definite article is termed 'General Germanic', 'Gemeingermanisch'.</p>

<p><h1><a name="1_4">4</a> North Germanic</h1></p>

<p><a name="1_4_a">North Germanic (Norse) is the language 'of the Scandinavian North, including Iceland, Greenland, and the Fär-öer' (Noreen, Aisl. Gramm 1). To what extent the Danish Isles had been Norse in pre­ historic times, is unknown. Jutland became North Germanic (Danish) after a large part of its Anglian (West Germanic) population had emi­grated to England, during the fifth and sixth centuries. The Norse occupation of Iceland began in 875; later, Icelandic-Norwegian settle­ments were founded in Greenland, the Fär-öer, the Orkn-öer, the Shetland Islands, and northern Ireland. The Norse settlements in Greenland disappeared during the sixteenth century, those "in the British Isles about two centuries later; in the Fär-öer (Danish), Norse is still spoken.</a></p>

<p><a name="1_4_b">'Primitive Norse' ('Urnordisch') covers the period from the earliest (Runic) inscriptions (end of the third century A.D.) to the beginning of the Viking Age (about 800). These inscriptions, of which we have more than a hundred, show hardly a trace of dialect variations, but during the Viking Age the division into Norwegian, Swedish (including Gutnic), and Danish became more and more marked. Norwegian and its offspring, Icelandic (and the closely related dialect of the Fär-öer) are generally termed West Norse, Swedish and Danish, East Norse. 'Danish' (<foreign xml:lang="non">dǫnsk tunga</foreign>) was the general name for the Norse languages during the Viking Age (800-1050), and even later. Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic developed independent literary languages, but Norwegian had since the end of the Middle Ages been greatly influenced by Swedish and later still more by Danish, and finally Danish became the literary and city language of the country. This was partly due to the political union of the three countries (1397: Union of Calmar; 1597: Norway became a part of the Danish kingdom), and partly to the Reformation, through which the Danish Bible and other religious writings in Danish were introduced into Norway. During the nineteenth century, how­ever, the Danish standard language in Norway was more and more influenced by the home dialects; writers such as Ibsen and Björnsen developed a new, classical Dano-Norwegian standard, but the success of efforts to create a purely Norwegian literary language on the basis of local dialects and Old Norse-the <foreign xml:lang="nor">landsmål</foreign>-is still in doubt, although they were sponsored by important scholars such as Ivar Åsen and writers such as Arne Garborg.</a></p>

<p>East Germanic is the language of those tribes that settled on the south-east shores of the Baltic, east of the Oder, during the last two or three centuries of the pre-Christian Era. Inundations were a primary cause of their emigration from Jutland and its surroundings, and over­population probably contributed. Historians report that the Cim­brians, who invaded the Roman territory together with the Teutons and Ambrons, were driven from their home in the Chersonnesus Cim­bricus by storm floods. The Cimbrians certainly came from northern Jutland, still called <i>Himmerland</i>, and the other two tribes probably had been their neighbors (Teutons from <i>Thyland</i>, west of <i>Himmerland</i>, <i>Ambrons</i> from the isle of <i>Amrum</i>, west of Sleswig?); <i>'Toutoni'</i> (acc.<i>-os</i>) are named on a boundary stone near Miltenberg on the Main,/EN2/ but they may have been Celts who joined them later on their migration, somewhere in the South. Of their languages we know nothing. The only reason for grouping them with East Germanic is the fact that the latter is a subsequent development among tribes that came, more or less, from the same territory.</p>

<p>The <i>Goths</i> were the most important part of this expansion. The earliest known form of their name is Lith. <foreign xml:lang="lit">Gudai</foreign>, with unshifted <i>d</i> for <i>t</i>./EN1/ It is identical with the first element of OSw. <foreign xml:lang="swe">Gutland</foreign>, Sw. <foreign xml:lang="swe">Gotland</foreign> (island in the Baltic Sea), <foreign xml:lang="nor">Götaland</foreign> (Götland, district in southern Sweden), and with Sw. <foreign xml:lang="nor">Gotar</foreign>, ON <foreign xml:lang="non">Gautar</foreign> < *ȝautōz, OE <foreign xml:lang="ang">Gēatas</foreign>. It is very probable, in spite of phonological difficulties, that the name is also contained in Jutland. In that case, ON <foreign xml:lang="non">Iǫtar</foreign> would have to be inter­preted as an archaic retention of the spirantic pronunciation of Gmc. in southern 3- (24) by the later Norse ('Danish') immigrants, in whose language it had become <i>g</i>. Bede's <i>Juti</i>, OE <foreign xml:lang="ang">Ytas</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="ang">Ytan</foreign> (designations of the Anglo-Frisian Jutes who emigrated to England) are hardly more than spelling variations of the form Gmc. <i>*ȝutōz</i>, <i>*ȝutanaz</i>, ablaut variation of *ȝaut-. </p>

<p>The Goths appear to have had their name from their country.	(Cf.Karsten, l. c. 85, where literature is given.) They came from a general district called <i>Gutland</i> , from Gmc. <i>*ȝeut-</i>, <i>*ȝaut-</i> <i>*ȝut-</i> (Go. <<foreign xml:lang="got">giutan</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="got">gaut</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="got">gutans</foreign>/). The Old Swedish <foreign xml:lang="swe">Guta-Saga</foreign> relates in legendary style, but probably with a background of facts, that Gutaland was 'bewitched' so that it was under water by day and above by night. But after the grandfather of <i>Guti</i> had settled there it sank no more: <foreign xml:lang="non">Gutland hitii fyrsti maþr þann sum Þieluar het. Þa war Gutland so eluist, at þet dagum sanc oc natum war uppi. Enn þann maþr quam fyrsti eldi a land, oc siþan sanc þet aldri.

But the bulk, according to Jordanes, the historian of the Goths, went from 'Scandinavia', the perilous shore, to the continent, landing near the mouth of the Vistula, at <i>Gothiscandza</i> (<i>*Gothi-Scandza</i> = Gothic Scandinavia, or <i>*Gutisk-andia</i> = Gothic Shore; = Danzig?, Pol. Gdansk). There they had been preceded by the <i>Ulmerugi</i>, settlers in the island (ON <foreign xml:lang="non">holmr</foreign>) of Rügen, and. the <i>Vandals</i>, who came from the district of <i>Vændæl</i> 'Fair Valley', surround­ing the Limfjord in northern Jutland; they were followed by the <i>Bur­gundians</i>, from the island of Bornholm (<i>Borgundarholmr</i>).</p>

<p>About 200 A.D., forced by overpopulation, the Goths migrated southeast, through the Rokitno Swamps (Jordanes' <i>Oium</i>), and settled in the plains north of the Black Sea. There they separated into two branches, the Ostrogothae east of the Dniepr, and the Visigothae west of it. <i>Ostro-</i> is related to L. <foreign xml:lang="la">aurora</foreign>, Sk. <foreign xml:lang="san">uşās</foreign> Gk. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εως</foreign>, Lith. <foreign xml:lang="lit">aušrà</foreign> 'morning light', <i>Visi-</i> (<i>Visu-</i>) either to L. <foreign xml:lang="la">ves</foreign>(<foreign xml:lang="la">per</foreign>), Gk. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εσπερος</foreign> 'evening' or, less probably, to Gk. <foreign xml:lang="grc">εΰ</foreign> <i>*wesu</i>, Sk. <foreign xml:lang="san">vasu</foreign>- 'well'. It is more likely that the names referred to the eastern and western location of the two groups, than that they meant 'the brilliant Goths' and 'the good Goths'. The most important Gothic document, the Gospel translation of their bishop Wulfila (about 350), is Visi-Gothic, but contains some traces of Ostro-Gothic influence, due to a later Ostro-Gothic scribe. The Gothic kingdoms were destroyed by the Huns, and later the Goths disappeared in the Roman Empire. But some Gothic settle­ments in the Crimea survived the Hunnish invasion and existed as late as the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>It is generally assumed that Gothic was more closely related to Norse than to West Germanic. The principal arguments for this view are 'Holtzmann's Law' (<i>uw</i> > <i>ggw</i>, <i>ij</i> > <i>ddj</i>, <i>ggj</i>, cf. <b>33</b>) and the ending <i>-t</i> of the 2 sg. pret. of strong verbs (cf. <b>73</b>; also see Hirt, <b>HU 22</b>). But these are hardly more important than the parallels between Gothic and West Germanic on the one hand, and Norse and West Germanic on the other. Among the former, the most conspicuous are the use of Go. <i>is</i>, OHG <i>er</i> as anaphoric pronoun as against ON <i>hann</i>; the develop­ ment of a prepositive article from the <i>to</i>-demonstrative in Gothic and West Germanic as against a post-positive article from the <i>n</i>-pronoun in Norse (<b>93</b>); the different treatment of the reflexive (<b>70</b>); the pre­vailing use of Go. <i>haban</i>, WGmc. (OHG) <i>habēn</i> as against Norse <i>eiga</i>. Norse-WGmc. parallels are chiefly the rhotacism (<b>28</b>), the loss of the reduplicated preterit (<b>62</b>), the umlaut (<b>41</b>), and the loss of the medio-passive (<i>74</i>). But none of these three groups of parallels is important enough to have any influence on the classification of the Germanic languages, and it seems best to consider the three groups independent branches. It is true, of course, that in the sense of section <b>7</b> Gothic and Norse are in many respects more archaic than West Germanic, especially Old High Gerrnan.- Cf. H. Arntz, Germ. Phil. 41 ff.</p>

<p>West Germanic comprises the expansion of the continental stock between the Elbe and the Oder to the west and south-west. Tacitus divides this group into <i>Ingaevones</i>, <i>Istaevones</i>, and <i>Herminones</i>, but this division is of relatively little importance for the later tribal formations, although the three branches roughly correspond to the <i>Anglo-Frisian</i>, the <i>Franconian</i>, and the <i>Upper German</i> groups respectively. The over­population that had caused the northern and eastern expansions con­tinued and led to a gradual spread over the Celtic territory west of the Elbe and south of the Hercynian Mountains. The former Celtic char­acter of this territory is to this day indicated by a number of features, such as the specifically Celtic type of village planning and a considerable number of Celtic geographical names. Of the latter, the masculine river names are especially noteworthy: <i>der Rhein</i>, <i>Main</i>, <i>Neckar</i>, <i>Inn</i>, <i>Lech</i>, <i>Regen</i>, <i>der</i> or <i>die Eisack</i> belong to formerly Celtic land, while <i>die Elbe</i>, <i>Oder</i>, <i>Weichsel</i> flow through ancient Germanic territory. </p>

<p>This expansion proceeded essentially in a form that might be com­pared to the opening of a fan, the country around the lower Elbe being considered as pivot, and led to the formation of these dialect groups:</p>

<p>After the Cimbrian and East Germanic migrations the Ingaevones spread from Schleswig-Holstein over all or most of Jutland and later appear under the name of <i>Anglians</i>. Probably they had even before that time occupied the coast region between the Elbe and the Rhine, where they absorbed the Celtic population. This earliest part of the West Germanic expansion represents the later <i>Frisians</i>. The tribes south of them, in present Hannover, Oldenburg, Westphalia, towards the end of the 'Germanic Migration' formed the <i>Saxon</i> Tribal Alliance ('Stammesverband'). This whole series of ex­pansions is often called the <i>Anglo-Frisian</i> group. During the fifth century the northern section of the Anglian group emigrated to northern England, and their territory in Jutland was occupied by Danes. Fri­sians and Saxons had founded settlements on the northern coast of France, which was therefore called <foreign xml:lang="la">Litus Saxonicum</foreign>, and during the fifth century, at first from this coast, but soon also from the main land of the Saxons, England south of the river Humber was occupied; 'Northumbria' was settled by Anglians, probably slightly later. Most of the land between Thames and Humber (Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Middlesex) can be called literally 'Anglo-Saxon', since it was settled jointly by the two branches. The name is first used by Paulus Diaconus (<i>Angli-Saxones</i>; eighth century). The first occupation, that of Wight, Hampshire, and Kent, is ascribed to 'Jutes', but these did not come from Jutland direct, but were probably remote descendants of earlier emi­grants from Jutland, who had settled in northwestern Germany. Since the Saxons became the political leaders, their name was applied to the Germanic settlers of southern England, although linguistically these dialects are more Frisian than Saxon. <i>West Saxon</i>, the language of King Alfred, might be termed the standard dialect of the Old English period (about 500 to 1066). However, some important works were originally written in Anglian, for instance <i>Beowulf</i> , which we possess in a later West Saxon rendering.</p>

<p>Anglian and Saxo-Frisian coalesced into the <i>English</i> language, which in the course of centuries absorbed a multitude of Scandinavian, Norman French, and cosmopolitan words, but the fundamental material of the language is almost exclusively West Germanic.-<b>Cf. E. Wadstein, On the origin of the English, Uppsala 1927</b>.</p>
	
<p>On the continent, <i>Frisian</i> originally occupied the coast region of the North Sea from southern Jutland to the Zuyder Sea, but it was gradually absorbed by German and Dutch; it is still spoken in northwestern Holland and on some of the coast islands.</p>

<p>The language of the <i>Langobards</i> ('Lombards'), who originally lived in southern Holstein and eastern Hanover, is usually classed with the Anglo-Frisian. But since it shows the High German consonant shift in its Upper German form, it should really be considered as closely related to Alemannian and Bavarian.</p>

<p><h3>II. German and Dutch</h3></p>

<p>The West Germanic expansion had started two or three centuries B.C. and continued approximately until 500 A.D. The Saxon group, its oldest layer, had more or less coalesced with those Anglians that had stayed on the continent. Although dialect differ­ences exist, the two branches have so much in common that in most respects they may be considered one group. But the fact should not be lost sight of that the 'Anglians' of Schleswig-Holstein and the sur­rounding country inhabit the only part of Germany that, in historical times, has always been Germanic. The West was Celtic before our era; the East became Slavic about 450 A.D. and remained so for centuries</p>

<p>Numerous Germanic tribes occupied Central Germany during the two or three centuries before and after the beginning of our era. The Romans safeguarded their dominion by the chain of fortifications called <i>limes</i>, extending from Mainz to Regensburg, which delayed further spread for a considerable time. The tribes of the central group grad­ually consolidated into the <i>Franconian</i> Tribal League, which occupies a wide zone in Central Germany, north and south of the Main, but also extends into southern Holland and northern Belgium.</p>

<p>The most important tribal group in the old territory were the <i>Suevians</i>. In 73 B.C. a group of them under their leader Ariovistus ap­parently occupied Bohemia, migrated southwest and finally reached Gaul, where they were defeated by Caesar. The Suevian expansion was thereby delayed, but not stopped. In 213 A.D., Suevians under the name of <i>Alemanni</i> reached the <i>limes</i>, and after several unsuccessful attempts to break it, gradually occupied southwestern Germany, where they have been firmly established since 409. The Suevians in Bohemia, under the name of <i>Marcomanni</i>, retained their connection with the home land as long as it remained Germanic. But by the middle of the fifth century most of the Germanic population had migrated to the west and southwest, and their land was occupied by Slavs as far west as the Elbe and Saale rivers, and in some places even beyond. Around that time the Romans withdrew their garrisons from the province of Vindelicia and, possibly under the pressure of the Slavic immigration, the larger part of the Marcomanni left <i>Boiohaemum</i> (= Bohemia., 'the land of the Boians') and settled as <i>Baiuvarii</i> in Vindelicia., which then became 'Bavaria'.</p>

<p>Continental West Germanic (aside from Frisian) developed two (or three) standard languages in consequence of political separation. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Netherlands secured their independence from the German Empire. Subsequently the <i>Dutch</i> language developed there as a standardized combination of the three dialects of that territory. Low Franconia.n predominates, but there are considerable Frisian and some Saxon elements. <i>Flemish</i>, essen­tially identical with Dutch, is standardized Low Franconian in present Belgium.</p>

<p>The other continental West Germanic dialects formed the <i>German</i> language. Its present dialect grouping is virtually the same as in Old High German times (about 750-1100). However, since the ninth century, there has been a constant Eastern expansion beyond the Elbe and Saale, over the territory that had been occupied by Slavs.</p>

<p>We distingliish the following dialect groups:</p>
<ul>
	<p><li>1.<i>Low German</i> (<i>Niederdeutsch</i>, <i>Plattdeutsch</i>), north of a line that extends from Aachen and Dülsseldorf to Frankfort-on-the-Oder ('Ben­rather Linie'). It comprises <i>Low Franconian</i>, <i>Low Saxon</i>, and <i>East Low German</i> (east of the Elbe).</li></p>

	<p><li>2.<i>High German</i> (<i>Hochdeutsch</i>), consisting of:</li></p>

	<p><li>a.<i>Middle German</i> = <i>Middle Franconian</i>, <i>Rhine Franconian</i>, <i>East Franconian</i>, <i>Thuringian</i>, and <i>East Middle German</i> (<i>New Saxon</i>, <i>Sudetian German</i>, and <i>Silesian</i>).</li>

	<p><li>b. <i>Upper German</i> = <i>Alemannian</i> (<i>Alsatian</i>, <i>Swabian</i>, <i>Alemannian</i> in the narrower sense, and <i>Swiss</i>) and <i>Bavarian</i> with its eastern expansion, <i>Austrian</i>. - For Langobardian, see above, <ref>I</ref>.</li></p>

<h2><p><a name="1_7_a">a</a></p></h2>

<p>The successive waves of expansion de- a scribed above had led to the formation of the Germanic tribal groups. Since we have detailed historical evidence for the most recent period only, we must broadly assume a general Norse expansion and a general East Germanic spread, but we can clearly recognize the series of West Germanic expansions. This process of tribal growth is reflected in certain features of the development of the Germanic languages.</p>

<p>They had become a distinct linguistic unit among the Indo-European languages through a number of far-reaching changes in sounds and forms. Virtually all of these changes exhibit a significantly homoge­neous character; they follow the same 'drift' (<ref>cf. Sapir, Language 160 ff.</ref>), revealing uniform characteristics of the several Germanic languages. The following is not a hypothesis, but a mere statement of facts, for which no explanation is attempted at present: Every Germanic lan­guage followed the general, more or less uniform, trend of development as long as it was in close contact with the main body of the nation. After the separation, this fundamental trend came to a standstill, but in certain cases a new trend developed. Thus, Norse and Gothic repre­sent the oldest layers within the Germanic tribes: In these languages the results of the Germanic drift are restricted to those changes that took place in pre-Christian and very early Christian times. But cer­tain characteristics of these languages point to the rise of new trends.</p>

<p>In the West Germanic dialects, which were formed essentially as the result of the Germanic Migration ('Völkerwanderung'), the symptoms of this process are highly significant. In the course of the fanlike spread described above, the Germanic drift came to a virtual standstill in a relatively short time-- perhaps sometimes in a generation-- after the settlement of each tribe in the new home and the consequent separation from the main group. As far as the effect of the Germanic drift is concerned, the north-western group-- Frisian, Anglian, Saxon, and Low Franconian--, together with its insular 'Anglo-Saxon' expan­sion represents the general West Germanic condition of the period when Norse and Gothic had become independent groups, while central and southern Germany were still Celtic. These dialects, from the point of view of the drift, are younger than Gothic and Norse, but older than the High German dialects. In exact keeping with the chronology of the West Germanic spread, Middle and Upper Franconian show very consistent gradations of the drift: Middle Franconian is slightly farther advanced than Low Franconian, and Rhine and East Franconian present still more recent features. The two Upper German dialects, especially in the older period, show the greatest number of features that are the result of the Germanic drift and are in that sense as well as historically the youngest among the Germanic dialects.</p>
