<p></p>

(a) Monophthongization.

Due to the strong stress accent of Germanic syllables, the first elementof diphthongs tended to absorb the semi-vowel glide, so that <i>ei ai au</i> easily became monophthongs, <i>ī ā</i>/<i>ē ā</i>/<i>ā</i>. Gmc. <i>eu/iu</i> resisted this trend longer; being a combination of a front and a back vowel, its component elements were more strongly contrasted.

<p></p>

IE <b>ei</b> became Gmc. <b><i>ī</i></b> everywhere in prehistoric times. The Gothicspelling <i>ei</i> is taken over from the Greek spelling of Wulfila's time, in which <i>ει</i> represented [i:]: IE <ie>steigh-</ie>: Go. <go>steigan</go>, ON <on>stīga</on>, OE OS OHG <os>stīgan</os>.

<p></p>

Gmc. <b>ai au</b> more or less preserved their diphthongal character into historical times, in part even to the present. For Gothic, the standard view assumes that the spellings <i>ai au</i> in Wulfila's writing indicated diphthongs where this is indicated by the etymology, but monophthongs [ɛ ɔ],where they stand for <i>i u</i> before <i>h r</i> (<a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#42_i">42i</a>). Jacob Grimm introduced the device of spelling <i>ái áu</i> for diphthongal, <i>aí aú</i> for monophthongal function: <go>wáit</go> [wait] = Gk. <gk>οιδα</gk> 'I know', <go>áuso</go> [auso:] = L. <l>auris</l> 'ear', but <go>baíra</go> [bɛra] = L. <l>ferō</l> 'bear', <go>daúr</go> [dor] = Gk. <gk>θύρα</gk> door'. <cite>Hirt, HU1. 39f.</cite> presents weighty arguments for the monophthongal character of Wulfila's <i>ai au</i> regardless of their origin; of course, there must at least have been a difference in quantity, short vowels representing the original monophthongs, long vowels, [ɛ: ɔ:] the original diphthongs; Wulfila's <i>e o</i> surely denoted the closed vowels [e: o:]. (To Hirt's examples might be added Jordanes' <l>Oium</l> < <germ>*akwjom</germ>, <germ>*aȝwja-</germ>,<germ>*auja-</germ> name of a watery place, and <germ>Berig</germ> = <germ>Boiorīx</germ>, <germ>*Bajarīks</germ>.) I believe that Hirt is right, but the question is largely one of chronology. Shortly before Wulfila's time, Gmc. <i>ai au</i> were still diphthongs in Gothic, as is indicated by the spelling (<go>Gutan(e) Iowi</go>) <go>hailag</go> (R. Loewe's interpretation) on the gold ring of Bukarest and spellings in Latin and Greek historians, like <i>Radagaisus</i>, <i>Austrogothi</i> (<cite>cf. Streitberg, UG 58 ff.</cite>). Shortly after Wulfila, they were monophthongs (<i>Ostrogothi</i>). Also inclosely related Vandalic, <i>ai au</i> had become [ɛ: ɔ:]: <go>froja</go>, <go>armes</go> 'domine, miserere' = Go. <go>frauja</go>, <go>armais</go> (<cite>Streitberg, UG 38</cite>). Crimean Gothic has <go>Broe(t)</go> 'panis', <go>Oeghene</go> 'oculi' = Go. <go>*brauþ</go>, <go>augōna</go>, where <i>oe</i> doubtless stands for [o:] or [ɔ:]; <go>geen</go> may possibly correspond to atheoretical Go. <go>*gaian</go>. In spite of the probability of Hirt's view, it seems expedient to retain the distinction between diphthongal and monophthongal pronunciation in grammatical discussions: <go>baíran</go>, <go>taíhun</go>, <go>baúrans</go>, <go>taúhans</go> = [bɛran, teɧun, bɔrans, tɔɧans], but <go>áirus</go>, <go>taih</go>, <go>áugo</go>, <go>táuh</go> = [airus, taih, auȝo:, tauh].

<p></p>

Go. <i>iu</i> < Gmc. <i>eu/iu</i> was a diphthong.

<p></p>

In Old Norse, the Germanic diphthongs in general remaineddiphthongal (but cf. <a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#42_j">42 j</a>) : ON <on>veit</on>, <on>steinn</on>, <on>auga</on>, <on>þiūfr</on>, <on>giōta</on> (<a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#41_e">41 e</a>) = Go. <go>wait</go>, <go>stains</go>, <go>augo</go>, <go>þiufs</go>, <go>giutan</go>. In modern Norse, they are monophthongs: Norw. <nor>vet</nor>, <nor>sten</nor>, <nor>øie</nor>, <nor>tyv</nor> (Sw. <sw>tjuf</sw> = [ty:f]), <nor>gyte</nor>.

<p></p>

In Old English, <i>ai</i> had become <i>ā</i> before the time of our earliest documents: <oe>stān</oe>, <oe>ān</oe> = Go. <go>stains</go>, <go>ains</go>. Gmc. <i>au eu/iu</i> remained diphthongal until the beginning of the Middle English period; <i>au</i> is spelled <i>ēa</i> = [æə], <i>eu</i> is expressed by <i>ēo</i> = [iə] (<oe>cēosan</oe>), <i>iu</i> usually by <i>īo</i> = [iə] (<oe>līode</oe> — OHG <ohg>liuti</ohg> 'people'). The macron on the first element,relatively rare in MSS, but used consistently in our editions and grammars, is merely an orthographical device to distinguish these diphthongs from 'broken vowels' (<a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#42_e">42 e</a>). The spelling <i>ea</i> for <i>æa</i> is due to the scribal tradition mentioned in <a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#24">24</a> —In ME monophthongization continued, so that both Gmc: <i>au</i> and Gmc. <i>eu</i> finally resulted in [i:]: OE <oe>dēop</oe>, <oe>hēap</oe>— [di:p, hi:p]. In part, this was deflected by secondary changes: OE <oe>dēad</oe>, <oe>lēoht</oe> > [dɛd, lait].

<p></p>

In Old Frisian, <i>ai</i> became <i>ē</i> or <i>ā</i>, and <i>au</i> became <i>ā</i>; in Old Saxon, <i>ai</i> appears as <i>ē</i>, <i>au</i> as <i>ō</i>: OFris. <ofris>wēt</ofris>, <ofris>stēn</ofris>, <ofris>ā</ofris> < <germ>*aiwa-</germ> 'right', <ofris>āgun</ofris> —Go. <go>aigun</go> 'they have', <ofris>āge</ofris> 'eye'; OS <os>wēt</os>, <os>stēn</os>, <os>ōga</os>. Gmc. <i>eu</i> remained a diphthong in both dialects.

<p></p>

Old High German ordinarily preserved the diphthongal character of <i>ai au eu</i>: <ohg>weiz</ohg>, <ohg>stein</ohg>, <ohg>ouga</ohg>; but before certain consonants <i>ai au</i> became <i>ē ō</i>. Cf. <a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#42_l">42 l</a>.

<p></p>

Toward the end of the Middle Ages, OHG <i>ie</i> < Gmc. <i>ē²</i> and <i>uo</i> < Gmc. <i>ō</i> were monophthongized in Middle German, and this was adopted in Standard German while the diphthongs still largely prevail in Upper German: OHG <ohg>briaf</ohg>, <nhg>brief</nhg> > [bri:f], <ohg>guot</ohg> > [gu:t]. Likewise, the mutated vowel of <i>uo</i>, <i>üe</i>, became [y:]: MHG <mhg>guete</mhg> > [gy:tə].

<p></p>

(b) DIPHTHONGIZATION

<p></p>

Although apparently the opposite of monophthongization, diphthongizationin Germanic languages was also a consequence of thestrong stress accent. Long vowels tended to increase the energy of their articulation. This had led to the Germanic vowel shift described in <a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#37">37</a> and to the later English raising of <i>ē ō</i> to [i: u:]. In Old High German, a similar process started during the eighth century, when <i>ē²</i> became <i>ea ia ie</i>, and <i>ō</i> became <i>oa ua uo</i>: <i>briaf</i>, <i>guot</i>. These diphthongs mark the transition to Middle German [i: u:] (see above).

<p></p>

A more extensive diphthongization took place in English, Dutch, and most of High German before the end of the Middle Ages. The high vowels[i: u: y:] were incapable of further raising. The stress accent seems to have caused further lengthening, resulting in 'slurred' accent (rising-falling accent, circumflex accent, 'Schleifton') and finally in diphthongization. During the articulation of the over-long vowel the tongue reached the highest point only gradually; thus, there developed a glide from a mid-vowel, later even a low vowel, to a high vowel,[i: > ei ai, u: > au]. The new diphthongal element was gradually more or less assimilated to the first part of the diphthong, so that now-a-days English and German generally have the diphthongs [ae ao]: OE OHG <oe>mīn</oe>, <oe>hūs</oe>, NE NHG [maen, haos], MHG <mhg>liute</mhg> = [ly:tə], NHG Leute = [lɔytə, lɔøtə].

Mutation ('Umlaut',a term coined by Jacob Grimm) in the widest sense can be defined as the modification of a vowel under the influence of and in the direction of the articulation of a neighboring vowel. In the Germanic languages the use of the term is essentially restricted to the change of a stem vowel in the direction of the vowel of a suffix or ending. Similar processes are found in many languages. In Russian, <i>a</i> is a low-back vowel before a back vowel, but a low-front vowel. before a front vowel: <rus>dar(ъ)</rus> 'gift' [dar] < <i>*daro-</i> , but <rus>danъ</rus> 'tribute' [dæñ] < <i>*dani-</i>. Irish shows a similar trend. In these cases the phonetic process is fairly clear. The intervening consonant is assimilated to the articulation of the following vowel, and the preceding vowel is assimilated to the consonant. This is a corollary to the peculiar plasticity of these languages. In some of the Ugro-Finnic languages there exists a similar process termed 'Vowel Harmony'. But there the stem vowel determines the articulation of the suffix vowel, requiring front or back articulation respectively, in accordance with its own type : Finn. <fin>huva</fin> 'good', <fin>pähä</fin> 'bad'. In a somewhat mechanical way we may designate the former process as physiological, and the latter as psychological assimilation. The impression of the position of the tongue is retained through the following syllable, regardless of whether the tongue is raised in front or in back.

<p></p>

Germanic mutation, while not identical with either of these two types of mutation, bears a certain relationship to both of them. Its origin is not known, but the following may be an approach to an interpretation of the process. The conditional changes <i>e</i> > <i>i</i>, <i>u</i> > <i>o</i> in the Germanic Vowel Shift (<a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#38">38</a>) were soon followed by the corresponding conditional change <i>a</i> > <i>e</i> in Norse and West Germanic. But while the former two changes were merely <i>prevented</i> by a following incompatible vowel, and therefore occurred also in final syllables, the change <i>a</i> > <i>e</i> <i>depended</i> on a following <i>i</i> (<i>j</i>). These three mutations tended in the direction of the general vowel drift. They implied an enrichment of the morphological pattern of the language. Distinctions between forms by gradation (<a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#45">45</a>) had been inherited from the Indo-European parent speech. The contrast between OHG <ohg>geban</ohg> and <ohg>gab</ohg> was the continuation of the Indo-European alternation between <i>e</i> and <i>o</i>. In consequence of mutation, a new type of interchange between stem vowels developed, e.g., OHG <ohg>beran</ohg>: <ohg>biris</ohg>, <ohg>hulfun</ohg>: <ohg>gifolfan</ohg>, <ohg>faran</ohg>: <ohg>feris</ohg>. In some of the Germanic languages this became a grammatical device of great importance. In connection with the weakening of final syllables,which had started before the period of mutation (<a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#49_A_1">49, A 1</a>), it assumed functional value as an auxiliary means of distinction between singular and plural, indicative and optative, positive and comparative, and other morphological categories. Perhaps this was one of the factors that led to a great extension of the new linguistic device, which no longer followed the general direction of the vowel drift. So far as the endings themselves are concerned, the speech feeling for the phonetic law back of them gradually disappeared. It is obvious, for instance, that in Old English there could not exist any recollection of the fact that the difference between <i>ō</i> in <oe>fōt</oe> 'foot' and <i>ē</i> in <oe>fēt</oe> 'feet' was due to the former plural ending <i>-iz</i>. All that remained was the functional variation of the stem vowel, which differed in degree in the various Germanic languages. It found its greatest development in High German, particularly in the formation of noun plurals. Through the weakening of endings, Old High German possessed many plural forms that did not differ from the corresponding singulars, e.g. <ohg>wort</ohg>, <ohg>turi</ohg>, <ohg>bruoder</ohg>, <ohg>man</ohg>, <ohg>naht</ohg>. In such forms, mutation was introduced during the Middle High German and New High German periods, in imitation of such clear contrasts as <ohg>gast</ohg> — <ohg>gesti</ohg> (analogical mutation), so that the number of mutated plurals in standard New High German is approximately six times as great as in Old High German.<EN>1</EN> A particularly significant feature of this analogical process is the development of [ø]. Phonologically, this sound could not have developed at all. Short <i>o</i>, from which it is nominally derived, could exist only as <i>a</i>-mutation of Gmc. <i>u</i>;but the change <i>o</i> > <i>ø</i> as a phonetic transition, would require <i>i</i>, not <i>a</i>, in the following syllable. Therefore, an alternation of suffixes with <i>a</i> and <i>i</i> would imply an alternation of the stem vowels <i>o</i> and <i>y</i>, not <i>o</i> and <i>ø</i>. We have certain instances of this alternation, e.g., ON <on>holpenn</on> : <on>hylpe</on> — NHG <nhg>geholfen</nhg>: <nhg>hülfe</nhg>; OE OHG <oe>gold</oe> < <germ>*guldo-</germ>: OE <oe>gylden</oe>, NHG <nhg>gülden</nhg>. But in most cases this alternation is leveled out (NE NHG <nhg>golden</nhg>; NHG <nhg>hälfe</nhg>, <nhg>hölfe</nhg>).

<p></p>

In the most extreme form of mutation, which we find in Old Norse, we may say that every back vowel was fronted by a following front vowel, every front vowel rounded by a following back (rounded) vowel.

<p></p>

Thus, the following fundamental system results:

<p></p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Before i (j):</th>
    <th></th>
    <th>Before u (w):</th>
    <th></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ă &gt; ǣ e<br></td>
    <td><br></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>ă &gt; ŏ</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ŏ &gt; ø</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>ĕ &gt; ø</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ŭ &gt; ȳ˘</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>ĭ &gt; ȳ˘</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p></p>

Note: In a limited way, <i>a</i> caused mutation of <i>i</i> to <i>e</i>, contrary to the direction of the drift. This seems to indicate that Gmc. <i>i</i> and <i>e</i> were practically one 'phoneme'; before <i>i</i>, both vowels appeared as <i>i</i>, before <i>a</i>, as <i>e</i>. Cf. <a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#36">36</a>. IE <ie>wiros</ie> 'man' > OHG <ohg>wer</ohg>; IE <ie>stighos</ie> > OHG <ohg>steg</ohg>; IE <ie>ni-zdom</ie> > OHG <ohg>nest</ohg>. But this change occurred only in comparatively isolated forms. Within the system of the strong verb it was counteracted by the leveling influence of other forms. Thus we find OHG <ohg>gestigan</ohg>, without <i>a</i>-mutation, under the combined influence of <ohg>stigun</ohg> and <ohg>stīgan</ohg>. But the change of <i>u</i> to <i>o</i>, which is in the direction of the drift, resists such leveling: <ohg>gigozzan</ohg>, in spite of the form <ohg>guzzun</ohg>.

<p><a name="2_41_b">b</a></p>

Mutation on this large scale began perhaps in the fifth or sixth bcentury and therefore does not exist in Wulfila's Gothic. Visi-Gothic names (<go>Ega</go>, <go>Egica</go>, <go>Egila</go>, <go>Emila</go>, cf. <cite>Streitberg, UG 2. 78</cite>) seem to indicate mutation of <i>a</i> to <i>e</i>. Crimean Gothic does not happen to offer any clear instances. In Norse and West Germanic, this peculiar fact appears, which I am unable to interpret: The extent of consonant shift stands in inverse ratio to the extent (and, probably, time) of mutation, i.e., the more consonant shift any given dialect shows, the more restricted is the scope of mutation in that dialect. This implies that Old Norse has the widest, Bavarian the narrowest scope of mutation, while the intermediate dialects are graded in a most consistent way in accordance with this principle.

<p></p>

The following outline does not attempt to go into details, but merely indicates the general trend.

In Gothic, in addition to the factor of chronology, the narrowing of <i>e</i> to <i>i</i> and of <i>ǣ</i> to <i>ē</i> were unfavorable to the spread of mutation, and the widening influence of <i>h</i> and <i>r</i> also counteracted a change that was contingent, not on the following consonant, but on the vowel of the following syllable. Go. <go>bairis</go> [bɛris]: <go>bairan</go>, <go>nimis</go>: <go>niman</go> do not admit any distinction between Gmc. <i>e</i> and <i>i</i>.

Norse developed vowel mutation very extensively, virtually to the limit of the general scheme indicated above. The earliest Runic inscriptions (4th to 6th century) show some unmutated forms: <i>gastiʀ</i> > <i>gestr.<EN>2</EN> The following instances illustrate its chief features:

<p></p>

'Breaking' in Old Norse can be defined as incomplete mutation. Genuine mutationiscaused by the high vowels <i>i u</i>. Breaking is caused chiefly by <i>a</i>, less often by <i>u</i>; <i>e</i> before <i>a</i> becomes <i>ia</i>,<i>e</i> before <i>u</i> becomes <i>io</i>:

<etym>
<ul>
<li>OHG <ohg>herza</ohg>, ON <on>hiarta</on> 'heart'</li>
<li>OHG <ohg>bergan</ohg>, ON <on>biarga</on> 'conceal'</li>
<li>OHG <ohg>erda</ohg>, ON <on>*erþu</on> > <on>iorþ</on> 'earth'</li>
<li>Go. <go>hairns</go>, ON <on>hiorr</on> 'sword'.</li>
</ul>
</etym>

<p></p>

This leads to considerable variations in paradigms, e.g., <on>skioldr</on> 'shield' < <germ>*skelduz</germ>, gen. sg. <on>skialdar</on> < <germ>*skeldauz</germ>, nom. pl. <on>skilder</on> < <germ>*skeldiuz</germ>.

<p></p>

Note 1 : <i>u</i>-breaking is in competition with <i>u</i>-mutation of <i>e</i>, which results in <i>ø</i> (<on>røkkr</on>). Essentially, the former is caused by vocalic <i>u</i>, the latter by <i>u</i> in consonanticfunction, -<i>w</i>, but the exact conditions are not quite clear; cf., e.g. Go. <go>fairhus</go> 'life', ON <on>fior</on>, Go. <go>aiha-</go> 'horse', ON <on>*ehwa</on> > <on>*iohu</on> > <on>iōr</on>.

<p></p>

Note 2: The term '<i>breaking</i>' should be applied only to this form of vowel change, in which actually one vowel is 'broken' in two. At best, it might be extended to the development of a glide in Old English before certain consonants (<a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#43_e">43 e</a>), but it should not be used for forms like OE <oe>giefan</oe>, <oe>geaf</oe>, <oe>gēafon</oe>, <oe>geoc</oe>, in which <i> and <i>e</i> do not denote any actual vowel sounds, but are diacritical marks,indicating spirantic pronunciation of <i>g</i>. Cf. <a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#24">24</a>. Least of all should the term 'breaking' be used in the meaning for which Jacob Grimm coined it. Since in his 'Lehre von den Buchstaben' he had letters, not sounds, in mind, he used it for Go. <i>ai au</i> — [ɛ ɔ] before <i>h</i> and <i>r</i>, and then transferred it to OHG <i>i</i> > <i>e</i>, <i>u</i> > <i>o</i>. 

<p></p>

Cf. <cite>Geschichte der deutschen Sprache 183</cite>.

Note 3 : While the direction of mutation in Norse is the opposite of Finnish vowel harmony (see above), its result is the same in principle. It is, therefore, not quite impossible that the considerable Finnish element that must have been absorbed by the Germanic Scandinavians had some influence on this remarkable spread of mutation.

English mutation in all dialect groups seems to belong either to the late continental, or to the earliest insular period. <i>ā ō ū</i> became <i>e</i> <i>ǣ</i> <i>ø</i> <i>ȳ</i>, but the latter two were unrounded during the Old English period,becoming <i>ē</i> <i>ī</i>; Northumbrian preserved <i>ø</i> as late as the eleventh century:

</ul>
</etym>

<p></p>

Mutation by <i>u</i> occurs chiefly in Anglian. It takes the form of genuine 'breaking', that is,incomplete mutation: <i>a</i> (<i>æ</i>) and <i>e</i> develop a glide before <i>u</i>, especially if a liquid intervenes; some West Saxon examples are <os>ealu</os> 'beer' < <gmc>*alu</gmc> (but <go>magu</go> 'boy', <go>sacu</go> 'quarrel'), <oe>heorot</oe> 'hart', <oe>geolo</oe> 'yellow', <oe>seofon</oe>, <oe>sefon</oe> 'seven'.

Old High German shows considerable dialectic variations. In all Franconian dialects the change <i>a</i> > <i>e</i> appears in our earliest records, that is, since the middle of the eighth century. In Alemannian it sets in somewhat later, and in Bavarian it occurs latest. Moreover, certain consonants or consonant groups (<a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#42">42</a>) inhibit this mutation more widely and effectively in the southern than in the northern dialects. As in Old Saxon; we can be sure that the <i>a</i> > <i>e</i> mutation was not the only type, but we have very scant orthographical evidence of the mutation of <i>o</i> and <i>u</i>.

<h2>Influence of Consonants</h2>

<p></p> 

In many Indo-European languages, particularly Slavic and Romance, consonants were frequently modified by the influence of neighboring vowels. This is rare in the Germanic languages.<EN>1</EN> The Frisian and West Saxon palatalization of <i>k</i> and <i>g</i> is almost the only instance. On the other hand, in Germanic, as in other languages, vowels are frequently modified by following, rarely by preceding consonants. The most important types of such changesare these:


<p><a name="2_42_a">a</a></p>

(1) <i>Nasals</i> exert an influence on preceding vowels in Primitive Germanic times. <i>e</i> before <i>a</i> nasal group follows the trend to <i>i</i> regardless of the vowel of the next syllable, and <i>u</i> before a nasal group remains <i>u</i> regardless of the following vowel : IE <ie>bhendh-</ie> > ON <on>binda</on>, Go. OE OS <oe>bindan</oe>, OHG <ohg>bintan</ohg>; Go. <go>bindis</go>, ON <on>bindr</on>, OE <oe>bindest</oe>, OS OHG <ohg>bindis</ohg>; IE <ie>bhṇdh-</ie> > Go. <go>bundeis</go>, <go>bundans</go>, OE <oe>bunde</oe>, <oe>bunden</oe>, OHG <ohg>bunti</ohg>, <ohg>gibuntan</ohg>. It is not likely that nasal groups were really the impelling cause of this vowel treatment. As indicated in <a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#38">38</a>, they merely formed a syllable barrier that prevented the influence of the following vowel. True, <i>i</i> followed the general vowel drift, while <i>u</i> merely remained unchanged. This is explained by the fact that <i>i</i> had always existed by the side of <i>e</i>, being virtually another form of the same phoneme, while <i>o</i> was a new vowel, developing from <i>u</i> under favorable conditions,namely, when the 'pull' of the following low or mid vowel was not counteracted by a nasal group. IE <ie>onx</ie> had become <ie>anx</ie>; <ie>ṇx</ie> > <ie>unx</ie> remained regardless of the following vowel, while <ie>uxa</ie> became <ie>oxa</ie>; IE <ie>tong</ie>- > <gmc>*þank-</gmc>, IE <ie>tṇg-</ie> > <gmc>*þunk-</gmc>, Gmc. <gmc>*ȝuta-</gmc> > NWGmc. <ngmc>ȝota-</ngmc> (Go. <go>þagkjan</go>, <go>þugkjan</go>, ON <on>gotenn</on>, OE <oe>goten</oe>, OHG <ohg>gigozzan</ohg>).

In Anglo-Frisian, single nasals formed a sufficiently effective syllable barrier to prevent a following vowel from influencing <i>i</i> or <u>u</i>: OE <oe>niman</oe>, OFris. <ofris>nima</ofris> (<ofris>nema</ofris>), OS <os>niman</os> (<os>neman</os>), but ON <on>nema</on>, OHG <ohg>neman</ohg>; OE <oe>numen</oe>, OS <os>ginuman</os> (<os>-noman</os>), but ON <on>nomenn</on>, OHG <ohg>ginoman</ohg>.

Note 1 : <cite>Loewe, GS 1. 39f</cite>., assumes Gmc. <i>ol or om on</i> < IE <i>ḷ ṛ ṃ ṇ</i> and consequently formulates a law Gmc. <gmc>onx</gmc> > NWGmc. <gmc>unx</gmc> (<a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#43">43</a>). The same law is necessary for Collitz's similar assumption, <cite>MLN 33. 328</cite>.

Note 2: The term 'nasal groups' includes <i>mm nn</i>: OHG <ohg>giswumman</ohg>, <ohg>gispunnan</ohg>. NHG <i>o</i> in such forms seems to have developed in Middle German during the 15th century. Cf. <cite>Paul, Deutsche Grammatik 1. 208f</cite>.

While Primitive Germanic <i>seems</i> to point to a development of <i>enx onx</i> to <i>inx unx</i> (the latter only if we accept the view of Collitz and Loewe), Old Norse shows the opposite, and far more probable, effect of nasal groups. Nasals before certain consonants nasalize the preceding vowel, lowering both its acoustic effect and its actual articulation, and then disappear: OE <oe>rinc</oe>, ON <on>rekkr</on> 'man', OE <oe>drincan</oe>, ON <on>drekka</on> 'drink', Go. <go>sigqan</go>, ON <on>søkkua</on> (<i>u</i>-mutation) 'sink'; <on>þorr</on> (name of the God) < <gmc>*þunrar</gmc>, Go. <go>sugqans</go>, ON <on>sokkenn</on>.

<p></p>

In Old English and Old Frisian, partly also in Old Saxon,<i>a</i> before nasals is nasalized (<i>ą</i>), and this is frequently expressed by the spelling <i>o</i>: <i>man/mon</i>. This is especially marked when <i>n</i> disappeared before a voiceless spirant (cf. <a href="http://prokosch.github.io/Part2#29_c">29c</a>) :OE <oe>ōþer</oe>, OFris. <ofris>ōther</ofris>, OS <os>ōthar</os>.— Gmc. <i>ǣ</i> < IE <i>ē</i>,which is regularly <i>a</i> in WGmc., changes to <i>ō</i> before nasals in OE: OHG <ohg>nāmum</ohg>, OE <oe>nōmon</oe>.

(2) Other Consonants.

<p><a name="2_42_b">b</a></p>

Certain other consonants influence preceding vowels with a gradedconsistency similar to that of the scope of mutation. Again, Gothicstands by itself. But for Norse and West Germanic we observe, although less clearly, the same general trend: The degree of consonantshift in any given dialect stands in inverse ratio to its tendency towardsvowel change. Moreover, there is great consistency in the degree towhich different consonants influence vowels. Arranged in accordancewith this, the active consonants are: % r I, dentals; w exerts similarinfluences, but can hardly be assigned a definite place within this scale.

The form of influence varies considerably in the several dialects, but thegeneral agreement is too significant to be considered accidentai. Theeffect of these consonants consists essentially in a lowering and backingof the articulation of the preceding vowei. A glance at D. Jones'svowel ellipse, 36 b, will show that this implies a trend of t towards e,a trend of u towards o. This must mean that in all Germanic languagesthese consonants were pronounced, more or less, with a marked retraction of the tongue. With { (the 'ach-sound'), and w this is selfevident.

For r I, and the dentals we must assume that they were atleast strongly post-alveolar, perhaps even point-inverted ('domal','cerebral'), as in American English, especially in New England, and inmany Scandinavian and some German dialects. Modern English offersobvious parallels to the effect of r and Z on preceding vowels. Weshould expect Germanic 5 to have a similar effect asi[,but this extremelyyielding consonant adapts itself to the articulation of the precedingvowel, becoming palatal afterafront vowei. The sameisthe case withHigh German ch ('ich-sound' and 'ach-sound'). Only Germanic^hasthe effect referred to, not ch < Gmc.

fc.

We must distinguish between the influence of these consonants onsingle vowels and on diphthongs, and their effect in preventing i-mutation.

(a) Simple Vowels:cIn Gothic,h(h) and r lower (and retract) preceding high vowels,i.e.,tu/hr>[ea],now spelled ai a&, e.g., giban, but saihan, sibun,but talhun, gutun, gutans, but tauhun, taiihans, wa&rbun, wabrbans.

'Gothic has actually preserved the Prim. Germanic

42. INFLUENCE OF CONSONANTS 115vocalism.' While the theory is by no means without foundation, it is difficultto accept it in full in view of numerous forms of the type of OHG fi.hu like filu,but beran like stelan, where the difference is clearly due, not to h or r, but to thevowel of the following syllable. It would require a most elaborate system ofanalogical cross currents to reconcile this with Colli ts's theory.

Nobse presents a fairly close approach to Gothic. It also lowers the dhigh vowels to mid vowels before h (which disappears with lengtheningof I H to 9 d) : A. M. Sturtevant, Notes on the x-sinking in Old Norse,JEGPh 31. 407. Cf. also Pipping, Inleding $23 a. *rihtjan, OHGrihten 'straighten': ON retta, OHG IVUi 'light': ON lettr, OHG sucht'disease': ON sdtt, Go. ptihta 'seemed': ON pdtta. The effect of b isdifficult to interpret. While Gmc. r has no effect on the precedingvowel, R < z (28) lowers f « to I o, but on the other hand palatalizes apreceding back vowel (s-mutation) : Go. mis 'to me', weis 'we', us'out': ON mer, ver, dr; OHG glas: ON gler; *kurun 'they choose', *kUr'cow' > kjro, kjjr (but acc. sg. fcu) show both lowering and mutation.

Apparently, the process of rhotacism consisted in a raising and retraction of the tip of the tongue behind the alveolae, as in a transition fromz or S to American r; this transition is unfavorable to high vowels, butalso unfavorable to extremely low vowels. That Gmc. r did not influence i and u is seen from instances like hirper 'shepherd', purfa 'may',NHG dUrfen.

In Old English, the effect of these consonants appears chiefly as e'breaking', similar in result, but not in character, to Old Norse breaking(41). The front vowels xei developed a glide similar to that in Swiss[ta^] = HG ich. The 'broken vowels' are spelled ea eo to, for [xa e» w].

x > ea before h, and before r Z followed by any consonant:Go. ahtau, sah: OE eahta 'eight', seah 'saw'Go. hardus, gards: OE heard 'hard', gearcP 'house'Go. barn, haldan: OE bearn 'child', healdan 'hold'.

e > eo before h, before r followed by any consonant, and before I if'backed' (velarized) by a following c or h:Go. aiha-, faihu: OE eoh 'horse', feoh 'cattle'Go. airpa, fairbus: OE eorpe 'earth', feorh 'life'OHG elaho, melkan: OE eolh 'elk', meolcan 'milk'.

i > io before h and before r plus consonant :Go. maihstus: OE miox, meox 'manure'*lirndjan > OE liornian, leomian 'learn'.

WGmc. a < Gmc. « was prevented from being fronted by a following w: OE (WS) sawon — OS s&wun 'they saw'. Gmc. 5 followed by a

116 PHONOLOGYback vowel has the same effect: mxg 'son', gen. sg. m&gas, dat. pl.

magum.

f Old Frisian shows traces of breaking, insofar as -icht- becomes-iuht-: liuht = OE leoht, kniuht = OE cneoht (cnieht, cniht). OldFrisian is contemporaneous with Middle English, in which breakinghad disappeared. It is therefore not unlikely that pre-literary Frisianhad breaking to an extent similar to that of West Saxon. (In theAnglian dialects breaking was more restricted).

a, which normally became e in closed syllables, remained a before hplus consonant, I plus consonant, and partly also before r plus consonant: achts, all, warm. ,g In Old Saxon ar al are sometimes found for er el: arthe 'earth', farah'life', walda 'would'. But this is rare.

k In Old High German, simple vowels are not affected by followingconsonants.

(b) Diphthongs. The lowering of the second element is a first steptowards the monophthongization of at au.

i Gothic. If Hirt is right in assuming that ai au were monophthongseverywhere, it would seem possible that they became that first beforeh and r, and later in all other positions, but that can hardly be proven.

j Old Norse monophthongizes ai au before h r to & 5: Go. aih—ON a'I have'; Go. *waih— ON v& 'I fought'; Go. air—ON dr 'early'; Go.

plauh—ON fid 'I fled'. With t- mutation, ON £tta < *ai^tjdm 'I had'(optative) ; with u-mutation, ON td < *tdhu 'toe'.

iu before dentals is lowered to id: Go. siuns—ON sidn 'sight'; bidpa'bid', but fliuga 'fly', kliufa 'split'.

k Old English, Old Frisian, Old Saxon do not show any influenceof consonants on diphthongs, due in part to their early raonophthongization.

1 Old High German has significant features. ai became e before ^ r w,and au became 5 before ^ and dentals. Before other consonants theyappear as ei ou. Doubtless, lowering of i u to e o was the direct causeof this monophthongization. In this respect at least, although not inthe case of the simple vowels, Collitz's generalization of the Gothiclowering of * and u is justified. The front vowel i was retracted andlowered by those consonants only that have the strongest tendency toproduce that effect (see above), but the back vowel u was affected byall of them, except w. That au before w was not monophthongized(MHG ouwe 'Au', Go. *aujd) is due to the fact that the articulation of

42. INFLUENCE OF CONSONANTS 117u and w is virtually the same, so that w could not have a lowering, butrather a stabilizing effect on u.

ai > 6. We find the spelling ae in some Bavarian eighth-centurydocuments, otherwise we have S'. Go. air, *gaiza-, *laiza-, taih, aihts,*taiha —OHG er 'before', ger 'spear', ISra 'teaching', zeh, pret. of zihan'accuse', Sht 'possession', z&ha 'toe'; Go. saiws, snaiws, saiwala —OHGsSo 'lake', mSo 'snow' (gen. shoes, sn&wes), seola 'soul'.

au > 8. Upper German, especially Bavarian, has ao during theeighth century; in Bavarian names this is found until 821. Otherwise,9 is general: Go. hauhs, ausd, naups, aups, launs, laus, stautan —OHGhdh 'high', dra 'ear', ndt 'need', ddi 'waste', ldn 'reward', 15s 'empty,-less', stdzan 'push'.

Gmc. eu appears at first in all dialects except Gothic as iu or toaccording to the following vowel (39). But in Old High German thereis found a significant difference between the dialects: eu before a becomes eo (later io ie) in Franconian regardless of the intervening consonant, but in early Alemannian and Bavarian this takes place onlybefore ^ and dentals, i.e., under the same conditions as those in whichau became oo = d. Again, then, we find that in Upper German thevowel development sets in later than in Franconian. —iu < eu + t, uis not affected by the following consonant.

General OHG Franconian only Upper German onlybiotan—biutu, biutis liob Hub, later liobfliohan—fliuhu, fliuhit liogan —liugu, liugit liugan, later liogan, liugitNote: This is the reason of the alternation between t'e and eu in New HighGerman: Go. jriuda-reiks 'Dietrich', *piudiska- 'deutsch'; fliegen, kriechen —erfleugt, kreucht.

(c) Mutation by following * is apt to be prevented by intervening mconsonants of this type. In Norse, Frisian, and Old English this wasnot the case, probably because in these dialects mutation was olderthan the effect of these consonants. In Old Saxon, a > e mutationwas prevented by h when supported by a following dental (ht hi hn hr),often also by r or I and consonant: haldid 'holds', mahti 'he might',trahni 'tear', wardian 'ward'.

Old High German again shows the usual difference between thedialects: A« ht and consonant + w prevent a > e mutation everywhere,I r + consonant only in Upper German: mahtlg 'mighty', wahsit 'grows',garwen < *garwjan 'make ready'; Franc. heltit 'holds', eltiro 'older',wermen < *warmjan 'warm'—UG haltit, altiro, (Bav.) warmen. This

118 PHONOLOGYdialect difference has been largely preserved in modern times, althoughthe mutated forms have gained ground, partly by analogy.

ACCENT AND ITS EFFECTS43. Indo-European and Germanic Accent. Accent, as an inherentquality of every syllable, presents two aspects that are termed stressand pitch. Neither of these ever exists alone, but according to thepredominance of either element we speak of dynamic (stress) accentand musical (pitch) accent. With the former the dominating factoris the degree of loudness, which depends primarily on the strength ofexpiration, with the latter, the rate of vibrations of the vocal cords,depending basically on their tension. Either factor may prevail to suchan extent that our acoustic reaction leads us to distinguish betweenlanguages of the stress type and the pitch type. Generally speaking,the Germanic languages belong to the former, the Romance and S1aviclanguages more or less to the latter. It is quite likely that in Indo-European, too, the preponderance of the two aspects of accent variedchronologically, perhaps also geographically. Hirt, HU 1. 51, assumesfour accent periods. During the first two periods unstressed vowelswere reduced and then, partly, dropped. The third period was markedby qualitative gradation (change of e to o) and further vowel reduction,and during the fourth period the vowels were stationary. This pointsto a predominance of stress accent during the earlier, of pitch accentduring the later periods.

But at all times that are within our reach, Indo-European accent was'free', thatis,the variation of stress or pitch did not necessarily dependon the morphological character ofasyllable (root, suffix, ending, prefix),nor on its rhythmical position (first, penult, etc.). For instance, theGreek word for 'man' shows these accent forms: Nom. sg. M/p, gen.

sg. 'iripbs, acc. sg. ivSpa, with the accent on the suffix, the ending,and the root respectively; one infinitive form of the verb 'to leave'isXtlrtw, another, Aw*!*. All Indo-European languages wentthrough some form of accent regulation. In Italic, Celtic, Germanic,the accent was, in prehistoric times, essentially fixed on the first syllable,which points to stress accent in those languages. Later, Latin substitutedarhythmical accent depending on quantity: Hn^eapid at firstbecame Hn-tipid, the change a >ibeing due to loss of stress, and latertn'etpid. Neither of these two accent shifts need be ascribed to anylanguage mixture any more than the Indo-European accent periodspresuppose any variation in ethnic structure. They may have been

43. INDO-EUROPEAN AND GERMANIC ACCENT 119an incidental feature of the general drift of the language, quite as muchas, for instance, the transformation of the verb system in these languages. The same thing is true of the Germanic accent shift.

The Germanic stress was not necessarily shifted to the first syllable. bCompound verbs stressed the stem syllable, while compound nouns andadjectives stressed the prefix, with the exception of the prefix go-,which was probably always unstressed: Go. us-^leipan 'go out', butlu9-lipa 'paralytic'; ga,-]leikon 'compare', po-'Imifct 'likeness', ga-^leiks'like'. The reduplicating syllable was originally unaccented, as isshown by Verner's Law in Go. saizlep, but was doubtless stressed inhistorical times: ON rero 'rowed' < *rerd shows weakening of the stemsyllable; Go. mm9 'sowed' has either leveled or not carried throughVerner's Law.

Note 1 : It, is not always possible to distinguish between genuine compoundverbs and verbs derived from compound nouns, nor, on the other hand, betweengenuine compound nouns and nouns derived from compound verbs. Go. utfrdleinsprobably is derived from utfulljan (cf. NHG Erfüllung from erfüllen) andtherefore has the accent on the stem; on the other hand, Go. andawaurdi 'answer'corresponds to NHG Antwort, NE anewer with prefix accent, but andwaurdjan,with loss of the vowel of the second syllable, seems to require stem accent, differentfrom NHG antworten, NE answer (verb).

Noti 2: Streitberg, UG 168, GE 160, Kieckers, HGG 100f.,assume for Gothicnouns stressed go-, on account of double compounds like ga-galeikdn 'das ga-leiks"aehnlich".

Nora 3: Loewe, GS1.

32, explains the accent difference between compoundverbs and compound nouns as follows: 'Es lag das daran, dass rar Zeit derAkzentzurückziehung Präposition und Verbum noch nicht zu einem einheitlichenWorte verschmolzen waren, wie dieselben denn auch noch got. durch enklitischePartikeln, z. B. in ubuhwdpida "und schrie auf" (uA "und"), utnugibip "gebtnun her" (nu "nun") voneinander getrennt werden konnten. So begreift essich auch nur, weshalb die got. Präposition and "entlang, entgegen" in nominalen Zusammensetzungen, z. B. in andawaurd "Antwort", noch in ihrer alterenGestalt *anda, in verbalen aber gleichfalls nur als and-, s. B. in andwaurdjan"antworten" erscheint: -a war got. nur ausl., nicht auch inl. geschwunden. Wiehier so war auch sonst in den Nominalkomposita, die schon idg. einheitlicheWdrter gewesen waren, der Akzent stets auf die Anfangssilbe des ersten Bestandteils zurückgezogen worden. Diese Verschiedenheit der Betonung führte ahd.

auch zu Verschiedenheiten der Laute, indem die Vokale vortoniger Silben verändert wurden, die haupttoniger unverändert bleiben; daher z. B. inÜOsan "entlassen, loslassen" neben antläri "Loslassung" und noch nhd. erteilen aus ahd.

irteilen neben nhd. Urteil — ahd. urteil.'Both the Indo-European and the Germanic accent had far-reachingeffects on the structure of the language. The former resulted primarily

120 PHONOLOGYin Gradation, the latter primarily in the Weakening of Unstressed Syllables(and, later, in the Standardization of Quantity of stressed syllables).

But the difference between these two concepts is rather one of degree,direction, and chronology, than of principle. On the one hand, quantitative gradation (46) implies weakening of unstressed syllables in theIE period, and on the other hand, the Germanic vowel drift is somewhat akin to qualitative gradation. Still, the two processes are fundamentally separate historically and must be treated without referenceto one another.

Gradation44. Ablaut (Jacob Grimm's term) or Gradation is a reflex of the twoaccent types of Indo-European. Pitch accent led to an alternationbetween front and back vowels. Since * and u did not function asgenuine vowels in Primitive Indo-European, except as the result of thereduction of diphthongs (36), this type of gradation is restricted to thealternation between the mid vowels e and o. Stress accent resulted, onthe one hand in the weakening or loss of unstressed vowels, on theother hand, under certain circumstances, in a lengthening of overstressedvowels. We call the result of pitch accent qualitative gradationor Abt&nung, that of stress accent, quantitative gradation or Abstufung.

Gradation is by no means a peculiar characteristic of Indo-European.

It is doubtful whether there exists any language that does not showsome form of quantitative gradation, but also qualitative gradation isfrequent. Of the linguistic groups adjacent to Indo-European, Finno-Ugrian possesses it only in rudimentary traces (e.g. Finn. pala- 'burn',trans., poltta- 'burn', in trans.; Ostyak mart- 'to break', mirta 'I break',murt9m 'I have broken'). But the Semitic languages possess highlydeveloped ablaut systems of a more consciously functional characterthan Indo-European in the form that science has been able to reconstruct: Arab. qatala 'kills' shows quantitative gradation in the conativeform ('Zielstamm') qatala 'tries to kill' and the causative form 'aqtala'makes kill', qualitative gradation, e.g., in the passive form qutila 'iskilled'; a stem like qatala, with the middle vowel a, has transitivemeaning; intransitive verbs have, in general, a front vowel in the middlesyllable to denote temporary condition, a back vowel to denote permanent condition (* u in Arabic, e o in Hebrew) : Arab. hasuna 'is beautiful',but sakira 'is (now) drunk', yabisa 'is (now) dry'. These few types ofablaut are far from conveying an. adequate picture of the great wealthand consistency of those Semitic systems, in comparison with whichIndo-European gradation seems very restricted and irregular.

45. ABTONUNG 121Among the Indo-European languages, Germanic, like all others, hasgreatly decreased the number of phonetic variations, but it has greatlyincreased their functional importance. In particular, gradation hasbeen systematized as the structural mechanism of the German'Strong Verb'.

46. Abtonung, Qualitative Graduation, is the alternation between %and 0. It is frequently explained as the result of the loss of accent.1But only a small part of the material can be reconciled with this, suchaa Gk. <pipu 'I carry': <poptoi 'I am in the habit of carrying'. Ingeneral, there is no evidence that e was the original and o the secondaryvowel, but the two vowels rather seem to alternate as equals, as in Gk.

\tyw 'I speak': \byoi 'speech', although such derivatives as <popktwere doubtless secondary developments. It is hardly possible at presentto venture any definitive explanation. But the obvious parallelismbetween Indo-European and Semitic ablaut may point the way. Inthe Semitic verb system, as illustrated above, the front vowel indicatestemporary condition, a passing fact, as it were, while the back voweldenotes permanent condition, a state of rest. In Indo-European, themost characteristic sphere of the front vowel is the form of presentaction, as in Xfcyw. The fundamental connotation of the back-vowel 0is condition: \&yos 'the condition of speaking', Xt-Xoura '(I havebrought about) the state of leaving behind', Xotrfe 'left behind',against Xcbrw 'I am leaving'. True, it is only in root syllables that wefind such significant traces of what may have been the origin of Abtonung, and even there Indo-European is very far from showing a regular,clearly definable alternation between e and 0 (cf . ped-, pod-, pdd- without perceptible difference in L. ped-, Gk. rod-, Go. f&tu- 'foot'), and informative syllables very few rules can even be attempted. But if theparallelism between Indo-European and Semitic ablaut has any significance at all, it must imply some sort of sound symbolism ('Ausdrucksbewegungen').

Acoustically, the interchange between front and backvowels means an interchange between high and low oral resonance('Eigenton'). But it is an empiric fact that high oral resonance is aptto be accompanied by high tension of the vocal cords, low resonance bytheir relaxation, so that resonance and vocal pitch generally, thoughnot necessarily, coincide. This can easily be tested by asking personswithout phonetic or musical training to pronounce 'high' and 'low'vowels. While interpreting these terms as referring to vocal pitch, notto oral resonance, they almost invariably select t or e (very rarely a)for the former, u or o for the latter, although physiologically it is quite

122 PHONOLOGYas easy to articulate t in a low voice and u in a high voice. Now, muscletension implies interest, and in speech this holds true especially for thetension of the vocal cords. It would seem, then, that the IE 'presenttense' is fundamentally the expression of interest in an action going onand is expressed by articulation with tense vocal cords, favoring theselection of a front vowei. Inversely, forms of rather abstract, remotemeaning, such as verbal nouns, tend towards relaxation of the vocalcords and, indirectly, towards back vowels.

Note: Some fifteen years ago, experiments with Felix Krueger's device fortesting the larynx vibrations seemed to indicate to me that in some modernlanguages, at least in German and English, the present tense forms have higherpitch than the past tense forms, although various emotional factors frequentlyinterfere with this general trend. Normally, the trend appears not only in formslike give—gave, sing —sang, sleep—slept, where the present has an acousticallyhigher vowel, but also in forms where the opposite is the case, like hold —held,schlafen —schlief, ru/en—rief, and in forms that are identical for the two tenses,like cut, cast, put. External conditions compelled me at the time to interruptthose experiments, and I have never been able to take them up again. Thepreliminary results cannot be considered reliable.

American nursery talk offers an amusing illustration. A little steam enginetries to climb a hill and says cheerfully, 'I think I can, I think I can.' But thehill is too steep, the poor little engine slides back and says sadly, 'I thought Icould, I thought I could.' The front vowels [i »] aptly characterize the activeinterest in the successful performance, the back vowels [o u] the melancholyretrospect to what might have been.

Recent experiments in 'phonetic symbolism' by E. Sapir and others (see J.

Exp. Psych. 12. 225-39 [1929]; Stanley Newman, Am. J. Psych. 46. 53-75 [1933])tend to lay a statistical foundation for this view. Newman's statistics show adefinite trend to associate back vowels with concepts of large or dark, frontvowels with concepts of small or bright. Obviously, this can be observed only inpaired nonsense words, since in actual languages the action of phonetic lawshas greatly modified the original conditions.

The e-Grade is characteristic primarily of the present tense of thematic verbs of light bases: L. ferd, legd, dried > died, *deucd > doued >ducd. But it also occurs in nouns of various types, especially in *-stems and root stems: L. genus, ped-. —The lengthened c-grade appearsin certain aorist types, such as L. legl, veni, Go. setum, qemum, OSi.

sedh, which are originally athematic aorists (see 46 and 56), L. vSxi,text (s-aorists), but also in some root nouns, like L. leg-, reg-, in whichthe long vowel is probably due to analogical transfer from the nominatives lex, rex.

The o-Grade belongs chiefly to the singular of the perfect and tovarious types of verbal nouns and root nouns: Gk. X&otra, rirov0a,

46. ABSTUFUNG 123USo/ma, X6701, too-, L. nod-. Also causative verbs have generallythe o-grade: Sk. vartdyati, Go. -wardeip 'makes turn' < *worUyeti.

Lengthened grade in <p&p 'thief (from <pkpu 'carry'), L. vdx 'voice' (cf.

Gk. fbm)*, Gk. irytii&v 'leader' (gen. -6»ot).

Apparently, also IE a could alternate with o, but a was rare and in many casescannot be distinguished from 9, for the latter became a everywhere except inIndo- Irani an, where it appears as 1. Therefore, Indo- Iranian evidence is theonly certain criterion of IE a: Sk. pitdr- 'father', sthitd- 'stood' (past part.) asagainst Gk. vari/p, L. pater, Go. fadar, Gk. ararit, L. status, Go. stops 'stead'prove IE s, but Sk. djati 'drives', dpa 'off' indicate IE a for Gk. tyu, L. agd,ON oka 'drive', Gk. iri, L. ab, Go. af. The rare 0-0 alternation is found in &yu:intptt 'furrow', ipx<* 'rule'—tpxvot 'leader', L. acer 'sharp' : oeris 'pointed'. Thealternation H-i is still rarer, but can hardly be doubted for Gk. (Dor.) <patU'■peak': farf 'voice' and perhaps one or two other instances.

46. Abstufung, Quantitative Gradation, consists in reduction or in- acrease of vowel quantity. Vowels that are short under normal accentconditions may be weakened or dropped when unaccented, or lengthened when over-accented. Normally long vowels may be reduced toslurred vowels, but do not disappear entirely. This statement may beaccepted as a general working principle for quantitative gradation, butit is far from comprehensive. It is perhaps safe to say that we are evenfurther from an accurate understanding of quantitative than of qualitative gradation. Nor is this surprising. Even in living languages thatcan be observed experimentally, phenomena akin to Abstufung oftenresist scientific definition. We cannot postulate uniform phoneticvalues for French 'silent' e, for the German or English article (definiteor indefinite), for the medial syllables of Ger. handelte, rechnete. Inspite of the great methodical value of historical and comparative analysis, which is sometimes more reliable than even experimental phonetics,we cannot expect absolute consistency in our reconstruction of vowelreduction in reconstructed Indo-European. However, certain schematic contrasts as indicated below form an indispensable and trustworthy working hypothesis, even though some problems remain unexplained.

The distinction between normally short and normally long vowels isbased on the assumption of two types of 'Bases', thatis,syllablessubject to gradation. A base may be a root syllable,aprefix,asuffix,an ending, or an independent particle. If, under conditions of ordinarystress, its vowel is short we speak ofaLight Base,if,under like conditions,itislong, we speak ofaHeavy Base. Thus, the Latin presenttense ferd hasalight base as its root, but reri hasaheavy base. Like

124 PHONOLOGYwise, Gk. Myn has a light base, but Swpor, L. dönum a heavy base.

An explanation why certain bases are light and others heavy is notavailable at present, but the distinction as such is of the greatestimportance. It might be desirable to use different diacritic marks forthe two kinds of long vowels, e.g., to write *leg- for L. ligi (lengthenedgrade of a light base), but *ktp- for L. dpi (normal grade of a heavybase) ; but unfortunately this is hardly feasible on account of the largenumber of forms where the classification is uncertain. Also, suchmarking might lead to the misunderstanding that there existed a phonetic difference between the two kinds of long e, which of course isnot the case: they are different genetically, but identical phonetically.

1. The Normal Grade, Vollttufe, Normalstufe, is generally e/o: Gk.

<pkpu—<pbpos, \tyu—X6705, L. tegd—toga. For rare cases with a, seeabove.

2. When unstressed, short vowels are either dropped: Zero Grade,Schwundstufe, Nullstufe, or weakened (slurred, 34, 38): Reduced Grade,Reduktionsstufe). For Indo-European, we can hardly draw an entirelysharp distinction between the two grades, but within the several IElanguages, analogy and varying habits of speech seem to have standardized their use. The 'Strong Aorist' offers typical examples ofthe Zero Grade: Gk. rkniuu 'I fly', Lrrbw 'I flew', lxw < *<r€xw 'Ihave', i-oxov 'I had', but it is also found in other categories: L. seded'I sit', nidus < *ni-zd-ot 'nest' (the place for sitting down), Gk. t{a%< *o-zd-os 'branch' (the place to ait upon, the perch); Gk. 86pv 'spear',but Go. triu 'tree'; genu, Gk. yfov, but Go. kniu 'knee'.

The Reduced Grade, t, = 'shva secundum', is especially frequentbefore suffixes with long vowels, as in L. mantre, patire, habire asagainst Gk. nhxa, L. pets, Gk. rkronai, OHG geban, but frequentlytakes the place of the Zero Grade if this would result in a consonantgroup that is out of keeping with the phonetic habits of a given language, or that would interfere too much with the phonetic resemblanceof grammatically connected forms. Thus, initial combinations ofstops, as in Gk. ttWcu (infin. of rtronai), or in Czech ptdk 'bird',are incompatible with the phonetic pattern of Germanic; st-, as ZeroGrade of set-, would be phonetically unobjectionable, but a past part.

Go. *stans instead of sitans would be too remote from the acoustic impression of sitan. This seems to account for the fact that the firstthree classes of the Germanic strong verbs, where the diphthongalglide assumes vocalic function, have Zero Grade in the past part.,

46. ABSTUFUNG 125while the monophthongal fourth and fifth classes show Reduced Grade:OHG gistigan, gibotan < *-bu&ana-, giwortan < *-wurSana- < *wrton6-,but gindman < *nhmon6-, gisezzan < *-shdon6-.

The Zero Grade of a diphthong is obviously the glide in vocalicfunction: ei eu d er em en alternate with iulrmn: cf. Go. steigan staig—stigum stigans; giutan gaui —gutum gutans. The liquids and nasalsin vocalic ('syllabic') function developed supporting vowels (u in Germanic) in accordance with 13 : OHG helfan, werdan, swimman, singan —hulfum giholfan, wurtum giwortan, swummum gitwomman, sungumgisungan.

Nora: The Reduced Grade of i-, u-diphthongs can hardly be established withcertainty. It is often assumed1 that t,i *u became i tZ in early Indo-European, atleast under certain circumstances (perhaps before consonants and in pausa).

The 'aorist presents' of the second class (l&kan, aVpan, tUgan) may be explainedin this way (but cf. 64), and possibly some of the i-presents of the first class, e.g.,OE OS wigan 'fight', OHG vUgant 'fighter', which phonetically, as far as thevowel is concerned, are indistinguishable from normal grades, have the sameorigin. Before vowels, however, m* *u appear certainly as tj wo, and it is hardlyever possible to assign such forms with certainty to either normal or reducedgrade.

3. On the other hand, short vowels can be lengthened. The originand nature of the Lengthened Grade (Dehnstufe) is still a moot question.

The 'Streitberg-Michels Theory',* which may be considered the prevailing view at present, ascribes it in all cases to the loss of a vowel ofthe following syllable, e.g., Gk. p 'thief < V,P°*, L. pes< **oSos, *pedos, rex < *regos, rar^p < *rartpt or VoTtpo. Thepossibility of such compensation must be admitted, but its generalization seems unjustified. A representative of the opposite view, whichfavors spontaneous lengthening, is R. Loewe (G. Sprw. 1. 49): 'Dieidg. Dehnung war meist lautsymbolischer, speziell dynamischer Natur,indem die Intensität der Vorstellung durch Längung des Vokals wiedergegebenwurde.' Spontaneous lengthening of strongly stressed syllables is so frequent in many languages that its occurrence in Indo-European seems at least probable—particularly in that very categoryof forms for which Streitberg devised the most elaborate compensationtheory, namely, the preterits of the type of L. sedimus, vSnimus, Go.

setum, qimum, OSi. sed*, nteh. The standard view explains these ascontractions of IE reduplicated perfects of the type *%lsdvmen, stzdarnen> *se\bmn. While this particular form is assured by Sk. sedimd, itsextension over the whole category is far less plausible than spontaneous lengthening. The functional use of this process in Semitic has

126 PHONOLOGYbeen mentioned above (44). Monosyllables like Ger. der, du, so, E.

the, he, we are regularly short or long according to emphasis. Thestandardization of quantity in the later development of the Germaniclanguages implies spontaneous lengthening of a phonetic, non-functional character. In Lithuanian, short e and a are lengthened whenaccented (geras 'good', t&kas 'path', instr. geru, taku). It is often hardlypossible to decide definitely whether lengthening is due to compensation or to spontaneous overstress, but for the type of Go. qemum thelatter assumption seems better founded.

c Lengthened Diphthongs. Like simple vowels, diphthongs are subjectboth to reduction (see above) and to lengthening, so that IE di duei eu oi du dl el dl dn etc. can either be original long diphthongs orlengthened short diphthongs. But in Germanic, as in most IE languages, long diphthongs of whatever origin shorten their first element(with the exception of H > 39). Therefore, Germanic does notoffer any direct evidence for the lengthened grade of short diphthongs,since the few fairly clear cases of e* < ei seem to be originally longdiphthongs. However, it does furnish indirect evidence in cases wherethe i- or u-glide was absorbed in the lengthened vowel so that, e.g., wefind alternations between IE oi and o < .di, ou and o < du, etc. It isnot known just under what circumstances these long diphthongs weremonophthongized instead of shortened, but the fact itself is certain:ei : e—Sk. vdyati 'blows', L. ventus, Go. winds 'wind' < *wentosoi : d—Go. haims, Gk. K&/iq 'village'eu : ou : d—OHG fliozan 'flow': Go. Jlddus 'flood', Gk. tX«t6j'floating'.

Other cases are very uncertain. Thus, Lith. leidu (leidiu) 'I leave'points to a diphthongal root, but the evidence of Go. letan, Gk. X^Sonai,L. lassus < *bd-tos is too strongly in favor of e/a (heavy base,see below). It is more likely that we have in leidiu a contamination,due to similarity of meaning, with lieku 'I remain, I leave' = Gk. Xchrw.

Heavy Bases are syllables whose normal grade shows a long vowel.

d Generally, this is e or d, more rarely &; e and d sometimes alternate;qualitative gradation of & with l or d is very rare. The reduced gradeis 9; rare instances of zero grade of heavy bases are probably due toanalogy with light bases. Lengthened grade of heavy bases does notexist; where the circumflex accent in Greek or Lithuanian would seemto indicate it, we have to deal with secondary developments of rhythmical accent in those languages.

Diphthongal Heavy Bases with ei diaieudu &u el dl al etc., shouldtheoretically show the reduced grades at vu 9l etc. Taking into accountthe usual shortening or monophthongization of long diphthongs, weshould expect in Germanic the normal grades ai/d, eu (> eo iu)/d,el al etc., and the reduced grades (a > a, 38) ai au al, but the materialis scanty and for the most part etymologically uncertain. Morphological considerations (64) make it probable that the verbs of the Germanic seventh class come closest to this condition. As far as etymologies are clear, they are predominantly heavy bases: Go. letanbelongs to L. lassns (see above), -redan, -rapjan to reri, ratus, saian =[sftan] 'or [sftjan] to semen, satus, fahan to p&x, pangd, blesan to flare,ankan to auged, tekan, ON taka, to Gk. SixrvXos. Go. letan—laildt —laildtum (analogically for *lailatum) contains in principle the same gradation as light bases like Go. steigan—staig—stigum, namely, e/o/a overagainst e/o/-. Many verbs of this class have reduced-grade presents('Aorist Presents', like OE cuman < *gwm-), e.g., L. capid, facid <*fcap-, *(hk-. Accordingly, the following parallels seem justified (Gothicforms are given, where not otherwise marked) :

The relation of thisdistribution of ablaut grades to the general system of the Germanic strong verbis discussed in 64. But this must be admitted: in spite of its systematic consistency, this interpretation is at best a good working hypothesis. The smallnumber of instances points to the probability of analogical leveling. Thus, theplural haihaitum, instead of coming from *-krid-, may be leveling from the singular haihait < *-kdid-. Besides, not one of the diphthongal verbs in this classcan definitely be proved to be a heavy base. The only more or less valid argument for their being that consists in their morphological parallelism with monophthongal heavy bases like lStan, tSkan (ON taka, aorist present with reducedgrade). The matter is still further complicated by the fact that st su as reductions of ex iu are not universally accepted. Hirt, for instance, (Idg. Gr. 2. 66 ff.,HU 1. 61) assumes that their regular reduced grade was i u. This would yieldan alternation Si eu/i u, as in Sk. dhayas 'nourishing', OHG I&ju 'suckle' : L.

filiusi Gk. ol0ap < *dudhr- : Sk. udhar, L. utor, OHG Mar 'udder'— or eveni/i U, since long diphthongs are apt to lose their glide: 9ijX^ 'breast', L. fel&re'suckle', femina 'woman' : L. filius; Go. fon, gen. funins : Gk. rvp, OHG fuir= [fy:r] 'fire'; Gk. <Xwi, Dor. ttfXuw < 'siv-elijos, Go. sauil = [so:il], ONOE sdl : Sk. sxVryas 'sun'.

67) we really have to deal with short diphthongs that are lengthened in certain forms, e.g., in OSl. mth 'thread' < *neiti- we have the normalgrade, in Go. nfyla 'needle' the lengthened grade, withii>i,while Lith. nftis[ni:tis] 'fuller's teasel' has x,i rather than si; cf. *klei-/kloi-/klvi-/kli- in Lith.

ilejit'Ilean', llallas 'slope', pa-ilQti 'stumble', hlitls 'pile of sheaves'. Thealternation ei/si/l = Gmc. eVat'/J for heavy basesisquite as likely as the alternation ei/vi/i = Gmc. i/l/i, which for light basesisnow generally admitted.

Besides, transition from light to heavy bases and vice versa was doubtless quitefrequent.

fDisyllabic Bases are formulae necessary to account for parallelforms like L. genu, Gk. ybw: Go. kniu 'knee'; Gk. Sbpv 'spear':Go.

triu 'tree'; L. augeo, Go. aukan 'increase':Go. wahsjan 'grow'; Sk.

lavas 'strength' : Gmc. pUs- in Go. Jms-(h)undi '1000', WGmc. Thxlsnelda;L. plenus:Go. fulls 'full'; L. gno-, Gk. 71*0-, OE cnawan 'know'< *gne-:Go. kann, kunnum 'can'. We have here to deal with doublegradation, for which the customary formulaisere, era. The formertype is calledadisyllabic light base, the latter a disyllabic heavy base.

Either of the two syllablesissubject to gradation, so that we may find

47. THE GERMANIC ABLAUT SERIES 129ere/re/er/er/ri and er& (a = e = d)/era (wa, if both syllables areunaccented) /rd. E.g., *§eneu shows the form *§enu = L. genu and*gneu = Go. kniu; *pele- appears as *ple- in plenus, as *pl9-, withsecondary loss of 9 in Germanic, in fulls < *phnos. Sanskrit grammar,preserving the functional value of these parallel types, distinguishesbetween sef-bases and ani(-bases, i.e., bases with or without i < 9(sa- 'with', an- 'without'). An instance of the former is caritum 'tomove' < *kwer9- (*kwel&-, Gk. w*XoMai); of the latter, vdrtum 'tochoose' < *wer- (*weU, L. velle), which may equally well be considereda reduction from disyllabic *were- (*wele-), or a monosyllabic light base,*wer- (*wel-). In a great majority of cases disyllabic gradation resultsin a metathesis of I r m n i u. The Germanic languages have not preserved it in grammatical function. Generally, it can be recognizedonly by comparison with other languages, as in Gk. Sbpv : Go. triu,but there are some rare cases of internal Germanic evidence, such asGo. avkan : wahsjan < *awg- : *wog-.

47. The Germanic Ablaut Series. Gradation was a factor of fundamental importance in Indo-European and has as such been particularlywell preserved, perhaps even extended, in the Gmc. Strong Verb. Itstypes have been arranged by grammarians as 'classes' or 'series' varyingin number and character, depending principally on the gradual advancement of knowledge concerning the IE vowel system. Jacob Grimm,Deutsche Grammatik I (1819) set up fourteen 'Conjugationen'; intheir OHG forms they are the following: heizan, stdzan, faltan, bindan,lesan, neman, werfan, (zeran = Go. tairan), gripan (sic; Go. greipan),zlhan, (Go. teihan), gizan, slahan (Grimm's spellings). The presentarrangement by seven classes, which had not been possible beforeCollitz's reconstruction of the IE vowel system (34), developed throughthe cooperation of the Leipzig Neo-Grammarians. It was, I believe,first printed in Braune's Gotische Grammatik (1886). Hirt, HU 1. 75,says rightly about it: 'Die Anordnung ist durchaus willkilrlich. Sieist aber eingebtirgert, und man ersetzt sie besser nicht durch eineandere.'The seven classes are, in Gothic forms:I. steigan — staig—stigum —stigans (t-diphthongs)II. giutan —gaut— gulum — gutans (u-diphthongs)III. hilpan —halp —hulpum— hulpans (liquid or nasal diphthongs)IV. niman—nam —nemum —numans (monophthong before liquid ornasal)

130 PHONOLOGYV. sitan —sat —setum—sitans (monophthong before stop or spirant)VI. hafjan—hdf —hdfum —hafans (Gmc. a/5 series)VII. letan—laildt —lailotum —letans (Reduplicating Class).

For the sake of historical continuity this arrangement is retained inthe chapter on strong verbs. A more logical classification, however,would be the following:Iight Bases with monophthongs: I a, sitan, I b, nimanLight Bases with diphthongs : II a, steigan, II b, giutan, II c, hilpanHeavy Bases with monophthongs: III a, hafjan, III b, letanHeavy Bases with diphthongs: IV a, haitan, IV b, stautan, IV c, haldan.

While we generally associate these classes with the strong verb, theyinclude, of course, all categories of words and syllables. Some Germanic instances follow :Go. ON OE OS OHG•: giban gefa giefan geban geban 'give'giba giof giefu geba geba 'gift'in i in in in "in'-ii -(t)r -4M -t* -u 2 Bg. pres.

132 PHONOLOGYUnstressed Syllables48. Quantity of Final Syllables. All morphological types of syllables —roots, prefixes, suffixes, endings —could be either long or short.

In the case of long syllables, Greek and Lithuanian orthography usestwo forms of accent signs, the acute, and the circumflex, ~ : roin^v'herdsman', Ifttis&p 'leader', but Lith. akmuo 'stone' (nom. sg.), 0tum'gods' (gen. pl.) : Lith. st6ras 'thick', kdja 'foot', but geras 'good', duktS'daughter'. In modern Lithuanian, and probably also in classical Greek,the acute denotes even pitch (Stosston), the circumflex changing pitch(Schleifton) : In st6ras, the pitch rises or falls evenly during the articulation of the vowel, in geras, it either rises and then falls, or it fallsand then rises. This is particularly marked in the case of diphthongs:gduti 'get' has Stosston, gausti 'resound' has Schleifton. Syllables withthe circumflex accent, especially those with diphthongs, are noticeablylonger than those with acute accent. We find a similar contrast betweenthe American and the Standard German articulation of diphthongs:Ger. Mai, Hans, neu are distinctly shorter than Am. my, house, boy, andthe latter may be said to have Schleifton. Certain German dialectsdistinguish between (er) haui, brant and (die) Haut, Braut by a circumflex accent on the former, an acute on the latter words.

The Greek and Lithuanian accents can by no means be identifiedwith IE conditions, but are largely due to secondary changes. However, in final syllables at least they do reflect IE conditions. The vowelsof IE endings clearly show three types: short, acute-long, and circumflex-long. It is virtually certain that the circumflex accent of endingswas in all cases due either to contraction or to compensation: theending of the nom. pl. masc. of o-stems was -ds < o + es; the gen. sg.

of a-stems had -as < -a + so; the nom. sg. of certain n-stems endedin -d < -6n.

In Germanic, endings with a circumflex accent show more resistanceto weakening (49) than long-vowel endings with an acute accent. Thisfact, as well as the Greek-Lithuanian parallels and the origin of endingswith a circumflex accent, indicates that these were really longer thanendings with an acute accent. At any rate, it is a convenient, ifsomewhat mechanical, device for the purpose of Germanic grammar toclassify endings as having one, two, or three 'morae' (time units),equivalent to short syllables, long syllables with an acute accent andlong syllables with a circumflex accent. E.g. :Nom. sg. masc. *dhwesos, 2 pl. pres. *nemete have final syllables of onemora: Gk. 0tbs, vinerf.

49. GERMANIC WEAKENING OF SYLLABLES 133Nom. sg. fem. *dhwesd, 1 sg. pres. *nemd have final syllables of twomorae: Gk. 0t&, vinw.

Gen. pl. *dhwes5m < o-om, a-om\ have final syllables of three morae:49. The Germanic Weakening of Unstressed Syllables. The strong astress accent on the stem (or first syllable) (43) caused in Germanic aprogressive weakening of unaccented syllables, which is particularlymarked in the case of final syllables. Roughly speaking, this may besaid: during the first two or three centuries A.D., i.e., soon after theGermanic accent shift, final syllables lost one mora. About five hundred years later a second mora was lost; another five hundred yearslater, a third. Naturally, this is an over-mechanical statement and agood deal of allowance must be made for deviations. But the followinginstance may serve to characterize the trend :The noun termination -6, as in Lith. akmuo 'stone', has three morae.

It appears in Go. tuggd, namo (48) as a long vowel with two morae.

With a corresponding ending, though a different gender, OE nama hasone mora; this was lost towards the end of the ME period, resulting inNE [neim]. The Scandinavian languages as well as Dutch and mostGerman dialects approach this, but Standard German, being highlyartificial and largely the product of spelling pronunciation, lags farbehind.

The following outline intends to show merely the general trend.

Numerous details are added in the Morphology.

A. Short Vowels.

(1) In Final Syllables they tend to disappear. Unless followed by bconsonants, they are not preserved anywhere; the low and mid vowelseo a disappear very early even before consonants, but the high vowels,t u, show more resistance.

Sg. imper. Gk. vkiu, pl. imper. vintrt—Go. nim, nimip 'take'.

o: Gen. sg. -so (Gk. 0tov < *0toco) —Go. wulfis, earliest OE -xs.

Before consonants, a < o is preserved in very early Runic inscriptions (4th to 6th cent. A.D.) and in Norse loan words in Finnish: Run.

HoltingaR, staina (acc. sg., < *stainam), horna, Finn. ringas, kuningas= Go. *Hultiggs, stain, *haurn, *kuniggs. —Before -ns, however, allshort vowels are preserved: Go. vndfans, gastins, sununs, OHG wolfa,gesti, sunu, etc.

The greater resistance of high vowels (t u) may be ascribed to the c

134 PHONOLOGYclearer muscular consciousness during their articulation. Probably thesame law originally applied to all Germanic dialects: after a long syllable, or after two syllables (which phonetically, or metrically, amountsto the same thing) they disappear sooner than after a short syllable.

This law, which seems to express a general trend of Germanic towardsaccented syllables of two morae, is clearly preserved. In Norse, earlyRunic retains t u after long as well as short syllables, but in literaryNorse they have disappeared in both cases, and only the chronology ofmutation (41) reflects the original condition: Run. Saligastin, magu,Go. -gasts, magu, ON mqg, giof < 5eftu. In Gothic, it would seem that tdisappeared, but u was preserved regardless of the quantity of the preceding syllable: gasts, baur 'son' (t'-6tems), but handus, sunus. However, forms like agis 'terror', hatis 'hate', riqis 'darkness' clearly indicate that for t the law was the same as in NWGmc., but had beenobscured through leveling in the t-stems. A parallel treatment of uis made highly probably by tagr 'tear' = Gk. hfatpv.

Instances for t u:i: *ghostis 'guest, enemy' —Go. gasts, OE giest, OS OHG gast*nemeti 'he takes' —Go. nimip, OE nim(e)P, OS nimid, OHG nimit*nemonti 'they take'—Go. nimand, OE nimap, OHG nemantGo. hatis 'hate', ON hatr, OE hete, OS heti, OHG [haz]Sk. upari 'above' —Go. ufar, Run. ubar, OE ofer.

u : *sunus 'son' —Go. sunus, ON sunr, OE OS OHG sunu*pefcu 'cattle'— Go. faihu, ON fe, OE feoh, OS fehu, OHG fihuGo. daupus 'death', ON daupr, OE deap, OS doth, OHG tdd.

Noni: WGmc. -u < IE a d (see below, B) shows the same treatment: nom,pl. neut. OE fatu 'vats', OS fatu, OHG (fax]; OE OS word, OHG wort 'words'.

but Go. [waurda]. In the OHG inst. sg. wortu < -d, u is retained through analogywith words like tagu, hofu. Also in the 1 sg. pres., WGmc. -u < -5 is preservedeverywhere by analogy : OHG bintu like nt'mu.

d When a disappeared after j w, these became vocalic (33) : j > i in *kunjam > Go. kunt, ON kyn 'kin', *rikjam > Go. reiki,ON nke, OE rice, OS riki, OHG richi. OE cynn, OS kunni, OHGctiunni are analogies from the oblique cases, with doubling of n before j(which would not have taken place beforei).

ON kyn as against rikeisdue to the chronology of the loss ofi.

At the time wheniwasdropped afteralong syllable, about 700 A.D., the forms were still*rikja, *kunja, which then became riki, *kyni. Somewhat later, butbefore 900,tdisappeared afterashort syllable, *kyni>kyn, but thisdid not affect the long stems. Cf. Heusler, Aisi. Elb. 39. Likewise

49. GERMANIC WEAKENING OF 8YLLABLES 135*herdja(m) 'herdsman' (acc. sg.) became Go. kairdi, ON hirpe, OE hyrde,OS hirdi, OHG hirti. The Go. nom. sg. hairdeis, harjis 'army' areanalogies from the gen. sg. hairdeis, harjis < -jeso (see below). Thephonetic forms would have been *hairdis, *haris.

w > u: *knewam 'knee' > Go. kniu, ON kne (explanation as for kyn;for lengthening of e, see Heusler, i. c. 31), OE cneo, OS kneo, OHGchniu. In Gothic and Old English, to is preserved after a long or anunstressed syllable, but that is probably analogy after the obliquecases: Go. hlaiw 'grave' (Run. hlaiwa-), OE hlaw, but OS OHG hleo;Go. snaiws 'snow', OE sn&w, but ON snxr, OS OHG sneo; in Go.

waurstw 'work', gaidw 'lack', piwadw 'servitude', iv may have beenmerely orthographicai.

(2) In Medial Syllables conditions are so irregular that a general rule eworking with uniform consistency can hardly be established. Levelingof forms and chronological differences have greatly interfered with regular development. Besides, frequently the original quality and quantityof medial vowels cannot be definitely ascertained. The general trendseems to have been that not only i u, but also a, were more apt to bedropped after a long syllable than after a short one. Cf. for a Go.

anahaitan 'invoke', andhaitan 'praise', allwaldands 'omnipotent', allawerei'honesty', piudangardi 'kingdom', allawaurstwa 'entire', ainfalps'simple', managei 'multitude', manaseps 'mankind', samaleiks 'like'.

For i, cf. Go. brup-faPs (compound of two t'-stems) 'bridegroom', butRun. SaligastiR (name), Go. riqizis, gen. sg. of riqis 'darkness', hatizdn'be angry'; for u, OHG Hadubrant, Haduwig, but Go. handuwaurhts'handmade', handugs 'skillful', ON hgndugr, OE hendig; Go. qipuhafts'pregnant'.

The treatment of medial i in the first class of weak verbs is especially fimportant.1 According to 'Sievers' Law of Syncopation' (Btr. 5. 23-61,78f.;7.

141f.)medialidisappeared in West Germanic afteralongstem syllable, but was preserved afterashort syllable:Go. nasida OE nerede OS nerida OHG neritaGo. sdkida OE sdhte OS sdhta OHG suohtaThe chronology of mutation relative to the time of syncopation of thegmiddle vowel led to the condition termed 'Ruckumlaut' by Jacob Grimm('Unmutation' by Curme, Grammar of the German Language* 315).

Evidently, wherever i had disappeared before the period of mutation,the stem vowel had to remain unchanged. In Old Norse we find thesame development as in the case of i-stems (salr:gestr, 41), e.g., telia'count', pret. talpa, but heyra 'hear', pret. heyrpa. The WGmc. condi-

136 PHONOLOGYtions are greatly complicated by the fact that the periods of the twophonological events more or less overlapped. In Old English, we findnerian, nerede 'save', fremman, fremede 'perform', deman, demde 'judge'(Go. nasjan, *framjan, domjan), in which mutation preceded syncopation; but in tellan, tealde < *taljan, *tal(i)Sa 'count' (about 20 verbs ofthis or similar type) syncopation had occurred earlier than mutation.

Similarly, Old Saxon has nerian, nerida, but tellian, talda. Old HighGerman shows more mutation in the Franconian dialects than in UpperGerman: RFr. zellen, zelita, but UG (and EFr.) zellen, zalta. Analogyhas largely done away with unmutation so that, as an effect of syncopation, Standard NHG has preserved it only in brennen, kennen, nennen,rennen, senden, wenden (brannte, etc.). In denken and bringen and thepreterit presents it must be traced back to Germanic times, cf. Go.

pagkjan, pahta, briggan, brahta, kunnan, kunPa; these preterits neverhad i.

h The development of medial je depends on the quantity of the preceding syllable. The difference was probably general Germanic or evenIndo-European, but it is clearly preserved in Gothic: Gen. sg. of jostems,*harjisa > harjis, but *herSjisa > hairdeis; 2 sg. pres. of joverbs,*nasjisi > nasjis, but *sokjisi > sokeis. The problem has beentreated frequently, but doubtless the difference is due to a difference insyllabication (cf. 33 b), which is in keeping with the principles of Gmc.

metrics, and also with the 'Standardization of Quantity' (50). Thenominatives harjis, hairdeis, for phonological *haris, *hairdis are analogical transfers from the genitives (see above). In hairdjam (dat. pl.),sokjam (1. pl.), etc. there was obviously no basis for contraction, andit is likewise quite improbable that -jis, -eis could go back to Gmc.

-jaz < IE -jos.

i (3) Prefixes in general retain their vowels. But there is some evidence of a tendency towards weakening in isolated cases. Thus^ Go.

at-augjan 'show' is doubtless cognate with OHG zougen 'show'. OHGhas accented fora, ur-, zuo, but unaccented fir-, ir-, zi-; bi- appears innouns, be- in verbs. English has given up ge- as a verbal prefix, asidefrom archaisms like yclept. German shows weakened prefixes in wordslike GlUck, Glaube, bleibert. In Norse, verbal prefixes were lost entirely.

B. Long Vowels (and diphthongs) of two morae.

(1) Final syllables shorten long vowels:j IE e > a in Gothic, > e elsewhere (spelled generally t in earlierNorse) :Gk. TaT^p—Go. fadar, ON faPer, OE fxder, OS fadar, OHG fater

49. GERMANIC WEAKENING OF SYLLABLES 137Gk. (roin)^ —Go. hana, ON heme, (the Gothic form may also go backto -on)IE -et (3 sg. pret. of weak verbs), Go. nasida, ON taipe.

IE & o > Gmc. d became a in Gothic, but u in NWGmc. Thisindicates that in the latter group the usual trend of the long-voweldrift was anticipated in final syllables, while in Gothic the vowelshortening must have happened relatively earlier. —NWGmc. -u < IE -&is treated like -u < IE -u; it disappeared sooner after long than aftershort syllables, cf. OE ar < *ais& (Gothic would have *aiza) 'honor',as against giefu, Go. giba 'gift'. For Norse this is not so certain,unless we consider words like sgg as analogical, or assume that thechronology of the u-mutation coincided with that of the i-mutation —which, of course, is quite likely. -« < -d is preserved in Run. (gibu)and in Norse loan words in Finnic (panku 'bracelet', ON spgng).

Gk. 6tk—Go. giba, ON giof < *gebu, OE giefu; OS geba, OHG gebaare accusatives.

Ved. yugd 'yokes' —Go. waurda, ON born, OE OS word, OHG wort; butOE hofu, OS grabu.

Gk. <tt«Ixw—Go. steiga, ON tttg, OE *stigu, OS OHG sttgu.

(OE -u remained fairly late in Anglian, but in West Saxon it wasearly replaced by -e, which was probably a subjunctive ending).

But before nasals, IE -d -5 were shortened to -a everywhere. Thisis hard to explain, but may perhaps be linked up with the fact thatelsewhere, too, nasals seem to tend to preserve the quality of the preceding vowel (42). Thus we find:Acc. sg. fem. -dm —Go. giba, OE giefe < -x, OS geba, OHG geba.

Nom. sg. of n-stem8, -6n (Gk. irytnuv) —Go. guma (can also go backto -en), OE tunge, OS tunga, OHG zunga; ON gume may correspond tothis, or to WGmc. forms in -a, -o (see below) ; but Finnic loan words ofthis type, like haka 'field' (ON hage 'Gehege'), as well as Runic formsin -a rather seem to point to -In. Run. tawiSd 'I did' indicates that-6m became -o > -a. The ending of Go. guma, anyway, is not identicalwith the WGmc. forms OE -a, OS OHG -o, which surely go back to -5;see below.

Diphthongs are monophthongized earlier in unstressed than in kstressed syllables; in fact, it is doubtful whether historical Germanichas preserved any unstressed diphthongs. While it is methodicallydefensible to pronounce diphthongs in Go. anstai, sunau, habaida, Hirtis very probably right in assuming that at least in Wulfila's time at auwere [eo].

In final syllables we have the usual reduction by one mora:3sg. pass., Gk. <pkptrai = Go. bairada.

138 PHONOLOGYThe Gothic dat. sg. of o-stems, daga, is usually explained as an instrumental or as an ablative (79). Both explanations are possible, butunnecessarily separate the form from the other classes and the otherGermanic languages. It is more satisfactory to consider daga a locative,like other 'datives',—*dhogho + i > *5a$ai > daga.

1 (2) In Medial Syllables long vowels and diphthongs are moreresistant than in final syllables. Thus we find :IE o > 6 is preserved as a long vowel in Gothic and Old High German, shortened in the other Gmc. dialects: Go. salbdda, OHG salbdta,ON kallapa, OE sealfode, OS makoda.

In OHG medial 5 is not diphthongized to uo. This may indicatethat it had undergone at least a slight shortening before the period ofdiphthongization. Before nasals, however, it became u in OHG, u inON: zungun, tungu (tungo) : Go. tuggon (oblique cases of tuggo 'tongue')This is in keeping, on the one hand, with the usual treatment of ubefore nasal groups or nasals in general (cf. OHG gisungan, OE -numen),and, on the other hand, with the analogous treatment of final -d, butthe matter is far from clear.

Medial e in the third class of weak verbs goes back partly to IEei/9% and partly to IE e. From the Germanic point of view the twotypes cannot be distinguished. Gothic has at, which is almost certainly[e:J, OHG has e, and in the other dialects the preterit of this classprobably never had any medial vowel (Sievers, Btr. 8. 90 ff.): Go.

habaida, OHG habeta, ON hafpa, OE hxfde, OS habda.

Gradually, medial long vowels are shortened everywhere. In theliving Germanic languages, long medial vowels do not exist.

m (3) Prefixes (and prepositions, which may be considered akin tonominal prefixes) show the tendency towards shortening mentionedunder A. Theoretically, we should expect preservation of long vowelsin nominal compounds, but shortening in verbal compounds, accordingto 43. But this is only partly the case. Apparently, the unstressedforms spread from verbs to nouns, but we may in part have to deal withIE double forms going back to a time before the Gmc. weakening ofunstressed syllables. This possibility is indicated especially by the factthat Gothic does not offer any evidence of long vowels in the prefixesGmc. bl/bi, Us/us, td/tu. It has only bi 'by', while OE OS OHG haveboth bl and W (be) : Go. bistugq 'shock', like bistigqan (verb), but OHGblspel 'example', biwurti (and biwort) 'parable', as against bigangan'pass through'; Go. us (ut) in us&indo 'extremely', almost certainly withshort u, like ussatjan 'found', urruns 'East', but ON preposition or, ur,

49. GERMANIC WEAKENING OF SYLLABLES 139OHG prep. tiz (and ur, t'r, ar): uzlaz 'end' against irtrinkan 'drown';Go. preposition and prefix du, duginnan 'begin', OE OS td, te, OHGmo, te («', za), zuohelpha 'support', agangan 'perish'.

Note 1 : Go. ut (tU?) ~ us - ur, ON OE OS OHG us - ur go back to IEid (Sk. lid) 'out of. These doublets arose in sentence connection from Indo-Hittite ablative forms in -los, similar to Gk. h (fem) — if, o6ru(t) — oBrwt.

Note 2: The vowel of Go. du is problematic. We must probably assume, withDelbruck, IF 21. 355f.,that in GothicOin proclitic position became u, but sinceitisan isolated form no definite explanation seems possible. For the consonant,cf. 17, under 'Residuary Forms'.

C. Three Moras existed only in final syllables. They are preserved nas long vowels or as diphthongs in Gothic and partly in Old High German, but are short elsewhere. Some of the most important types arethe following:Contraction: Nom. pl. of o-stems (masc.), o-es > os, of d-stems (fem.),&-es > 3s, in Go. dagds, gibds, OHG toga, geb&, but ON dagar, giafar,OE giefe < OS geba.

Gen. pl., originally only of o- and (J-stems, but transferred to allclasses, masc. and neut. e-om > em for Gothic, o-om > dm elsewhere,Srcm > dm in all dialects: Go. dage, OHG tagd (original length certain,although not indicated by spelling), OS dago, ON daga, OE daga; Go.

gibd, OS gebo, ON giqfa, OE giefa.

Compensation for IE loss of final vowel: gen. sg. fem. -d-so > S«(fcaj), Go. gibds, OHG geba, ON giafar, OE giefe<-z, OS geba.

Compensation for loss of n in sentence connection: The nom. sg. ofn-etems, -6n, probably lost n before«(and before bh dh gh,ifthese werereally voiceless spirants,<p6x), but retaineditbefore other consonantsand vowels, so that we find the doublets 5/bn, as in Gk. jytpto, butL. homd: Go. tuggd, hairtd, ON tunga, hiarta (feminines and neuters),OE guma, OS gumo, OHG gomo (masc.) go back to -5, but Go. masc.

guma, ON gume, OE fem. tunge, OS tunga, OHG zunga go back to -toi(or -in, in the case of Gothic and Old Norse).

Note: Similar in phonetic principle, but different in chronologyisthe treatment of -on* (acc. pl. ending) in Anglo-Frisian (OE OS OFris.). In these dialectsn disappeared befores,with compensatory lengthening of the vowel:OE dagaa< -ds, OS dagos are really accusatives, which, however, function also as nom. pl.

D. Final Consonants in unaccented syllables disappear in Primitive Gmc. with the exception of « and r; r remains in all dialects, sremains as a in Gothic, as r (rhotacism) in Norse, but disappears inWGmc.:-r: Go. fadar, ON faper, OE fxder, OS fadar, OHG fater.

-s: Go. dags, ON dagr, OE dxg, OS dag, OHG tag.

-iw remains intact in Gothic and preserves the preceding vowel: dagans,gastins, sununs, but OHG taga, gasti, sunu*. In the Anglo-Frisiandialects, where n was lost, with compensatory lengthening (seeNote above), s was preserved. This seems to indicate that n waspartly assimilated to s, strengthening its articulation. We have aparallel in Italic: -ons > -ds in Latin, but -uss in Oscan: horids'gardens', feihtiss 'walls'; the nom. pl. of the latter word is *feihus< Ss, corresponding to Go. dagds, OHG tag&.

-t: Secondary ending -nt: Go. budun, ON bupo, OE budon, OS budun,OHG butun (but Go. -and, OHG -ant, 3 pl. pres., < -onti).

-n, -m: acc. sg. Go. dag < -om, giba < -&m; nom. sg. of n-stems: Go.

guma < -6n (see above).

-m first became -n, which disappeared in endings, but was preserved inmonosyllables: Go. pan 'then'—L. tum; pana = pan-a.

60. Standardization of Quantity. The combination of pitch and stress accenthad resulted in gradation (44). The Germanic stress accent led to the weakeningor loss of unstressed syllables, and it was a contributing factor in monophthongizationand diphthongization (40). A continuation of its effect is seen in a standardization of the quantity of accented syllables that took place in all Germaniclanguages during the 13th and 14th centuries. The details differ considerablyin the several languages, but the principle is the same everywhere: short accentedvowels in open syllables are lengthened. In Dutch, the contrast between longand short vowels is least noticeable; it is largely superseded by the contrastbetween volkomen (tense) and onvolkomen (lax) vowels. In English, the influence of the following consonant greatly obscured the underlying principle. It isseen most clearly in German, where the process is fundamentally the following:In MHG, accented syllables were of four types: open-short, ne-men, open-long,nil-men, closed-short, dahte 'covered' (NHG deckle), closed-long, ddhte 'thought'Towards the end of the MHG period, the first and fourth types disappeared ; nemenbecame nehmen, dahte became dachte. This means that MHG accented syllableshad either one or two or three time units—short vowel without consonant, shortvowel with consonant, long vowel without consonant, long vowel with consonant.

In Standard NHG, leaving aside complicated details, it may be said that everyaccented syllable has two time units—short vowel with consonant, or long vowelwithout consonant.
